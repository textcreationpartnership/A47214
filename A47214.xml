         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <hi>NAture, Duty, Chriſtian Piety,</hi> have invited, urged, obliged me (after Twenty Years ſearch in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>Religion)</hi> to propoſe unto you the Evangelical Truth; which this little Treatiſe, here humbly Offered up at the <hi>Altar</hi> of your Favour, will doubtleſs diſcover un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to you: For therein you will find (if affection overmuch dimm not the eye of <hi>Reaſon)</hi> a Richer Jewel, than any that comes from the <hi>Indies:</hi> The ineſtimable <hi>Margarite,</hi> I mean of the <hi>Goſpel;</hi> that is, the <hi>True, Divine,</hi> and ſaving <hi>Faith of Chriſt.</hi> Which being but one, as here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after is convinced, how ſtudiouſly the ſame ought to be ſearched out; eſpecially in theſe our times, ſo fruitful of oppoſite and contrary <hi>Religions,</hi> the worth of your Souls, the long Eternity of Joy, or of Sorrow, which we are to inherit, cannot but dictate unto you.</p>
            <p>Eſteem me not to brag, before you read, what I write: neither Arraign me as Guilty at the Bar of your <hi>Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:95768:5"/> nor paſs your <hi>Verdict</hi> upon me, till you have well examined (by weighing my Arguments in the impar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial Ballance of right Reaſon) whether <hi>Truth</hi> muſt Crown, or Errour Diſgrace, and caſt me. I crave not a <hi>milde,</hi> but a <hi>juſt Cenſure.</hi> I fear not Reaſon, but <hi>Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion:</hi> not <hi>ſolid Learning,</hi> but <hi>partial Affection:</hi> not certain <hi>Knowledge,</hi> but <hi>prejudicate Opinions;</hi> which the <hi>Tongues</hi> and <hi>Pens</hi> of your <hi>Educators</hi> and <hi>Teachers,</hi> by miſ-information, have ingendred in you. And therefore I adjure you by the <hi>Judgement-Seat</hi> of Chriſt, (before which we are all one day to ſtand) if you love your Souls, take not all for <hi>Truth,</hi> (touching the <hi>Old Religion,</hi> commonly ſtyl'd <hi>Papiſtry)</hi> which is delivered unto you, by thoſe, who enjoy fair Women in Rich Benifices (provided by your Fore-Fathers for <hi>chaſte Prieſts)</hi> by <hi>diſgracing, treading down,</hi> and keeping under this <hi>Religion.</hi> Which to be far other, than you are made to believe, the worth of your <hi>Progenitours</hi> cannot but aſſure you: Whom to have been earneſt <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſors</hi> of the ſame, you cannot doubt.</p>
            <p>For, if you but read your <hi>Chronicles:</hi> If you but look upon the Windows of your <hi>Churches:</hi> If you but reflect upon the Names of the ſame <hi>Churches,</hi> of divers Days of the Year, of divers of your Colledges, upon the <hi>Croſſes</hi> every where erected: Upon the multitude of <hi>Monaſteries, Abbies,</hi> and other <hi>Religious Houſes;</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:95768:5"/> which heretofore flouriſhed in this Kingdom: You cannot doubt, but that your Noble Progenitors, almoſt for the ſpace of a thouſand Years, were zealous <hi>Papiſts.</hi> Caſt your Eyes then upon their Wiſdom known by the Government, and Laws which they eſtabliſhed: upon their Piety, blazoned by the <hi>goodly Churches,</hi> by the <hi>ſtately Monaſteries,</hi> by the <hi>Renowned Colledges,</hi> which they Erected and Endowed; and Cenſure them not to have been ſo <hi>ſtupid,</hi> ſo <hi>ungodly,</hi> that with ſo <hi>great Zeal</hi> and Coſts, they would have embraced, honoured, and eſtabliſhed <hi>Papiſtry;</hi> had it been ſo abſurd, ſo ungroun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, ſo <hi>Superſtitious</hi> and <hi>Idolatrous,</hi> and ſo dangerous to <hi>Princes</hi> and their States, as divers of your <hi>deceived,</hi> or <hi>deceiving Teachers</hi> do bear you in hand. Neither think your Neighbours, who live <hi>Papiſts</hi> amongſt you, ſo blockiſh, that they would forſake the eaſie and <hi>fleſh-plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing Religion</hi> of <hi>Luther, Calvin,</hi> and other <hi>new Teachers,</hi> to embrace, with ſo great loſs and hazards, the auſtere <hi>Profeſſion</hi> of <hi>Papiſts;</hi> if the ſame were ſuch, as you are made to believe.</p>
            <p>Let not then any <hi>prejudicate conceipts,</hi> defraud you of this fit Opportunity, to free your ſelves from the worſt of all miſtakings; and conſequently from the fruitleſs pangs of <hi>too late Repentance;</hi> wherewith every one will be fearfully afflicted, that departs this life culpably, in a wrong and falſe <hi>Religion;</hi> when the Judging Light of
<pb facs="tcp:95768:6"/> 
               <hi>Chriſt,</hi> ſhall lay open to him, how naked he is, (through his own <hi>irremediable negligence)</hi> of <hi>Divine Faith,</hi> of <hi>Heavenly Charity,</hi> and of other Celeſtial Virtues abſolutely neceſſary to Salvation.</p>
            <p>But take me not here to invite, or urge you to any <hi>Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culian</hi> Labour; to the tedious Reading, and difficile diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſſing of the particular <hi>Controverſies</hi> about <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Religion</hi> now in queſtion amongſt <hi>Chriſtian People;</hi> which few, I know, have leiſure, or means; fewer Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity to look throughly unto, or ability to diſtinguiſh al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways <hi>Light</hi> from <hi>Darkneſs, Truth</hi> from <hi>Falſehood</hi> in them. But my Endeavour is, to ſtir you up to a <hi>ſerious conſideration</hi> of certain <hi>general Heads,</hi> and undenyable <hi>Truths,</hi> (which this little Treatiſe doth pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent unto you) eaſie to be conceiv'd, yet powerful to lay open even to mean Underſtandings, the aſſured Light of the <hi>True Goſpel</hi> of Chriſt, and the abſolute neceſſity of admitting ſome ſure and un-erring <hi>Interpreter</hi> of God's Word, by him ordained, and enabled to deliver the right meaning thereof unto us in all Ages; but eſpecially, when Controverſies about <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Religion</hi> are rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed: which <hi>Interpreter</hi> being once admitted of, and agreed upon, all other <hi>Controverſies</hi> about points of Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief, will quickly be at an end; Peace will be reſtored again to <hi>Chriſtians;</hi> and nothing will remain for the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curing of Souls conjoin'd together in the <hi>Communion of</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:95768:6"/> 
               <hi>Saints,</hi> but a ſtudious care to decline from Evil, and to do Good, and Induſtriouſly to imitate the Bleſſed Life of <hi>Chriſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But further yet to facilitate this affair: be pleaſed to diſtinguiſh in the <hi>Belief of Catholicks</hi> (whom I often call <hi>Papiſts,</hi> to condeſcend to the Style of <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> ſo terming them, for adhering in <hi>Religion,</hi> to the <hi>Pope</hi> (in Latine <hi>Papa,</hi> this word ſignifying <hi>Father)</hi> as the common Spiritual Father of <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> and ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme Paſtor of the Flock of <hi>Chriſt)</hi> be pleaſed, I ſay, to diſtinguiſh in the Belief of <hi>Catholicks, Divine Faith</hi> from <hi>Humane:</hi> Their <hi>Articles of Faith,</hi> from Humane Stories; which many diſtinguiſhing not; and thereupon perſwading themſelves, that <hi>Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licks</hi> with equal certainty and obligation believe the one and the other, that is, their <hi>Articles of Faith,</hi> and the Humane Stories, which relate the Lives, Actions, and <hi>Miracles</hi> of certain Saints; and finding ſome of theſe to be very ſtrange, and to ſavour (in their conceit) of fraudulent Fictions; take this to be a ſufficient War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant for them to contemn <hi>Papiſtry,</hi> as a fooliſh, ungroun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, and <hi>fabulous Religion,</hi> and to repute <hi>Papiſts</hi> indiſcreetly credulous, and plainly to be led in darkneſs and blindneſs.</p>
            <p>But theſe do much miſtake; for the truth is, that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though all <hi>Catholicks</hi> be ſtrictly bound to believe thoſe <hi>points of Doctrine,</hi> which their <hi>Church</hi> doth propoſe
<pb facs="tcp:95768:7"/> for <hi>Articles of Faith,</hi> contained in the written word of God, or in the perpetual <hi>Tradition of the Church;</hi> or deduced by <hi>General Councils,</hi> or by the <hi>Paſtors of the Church,</hi> out of God's Word, when <hi>Hereſies</hi> are condemned: yet they are not bound to believe the Relations of particular Authors, concerning the <hi>Actions</hi> and <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles</hi> of <hi>Saints,</hi> or other like things, farther then diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creet Prudence and <hi>Chriſtian Piety</hi> doth lead them; every Man being at liberty to weigh the worth and honeſty of the Relator, and the probability of the thing related, and then to believe, or not to believe, as Reaſon and Piety ſhall dictate unto him: Yet not forgetting, that God is admirable in his Saints: That His <hi>Wiſdom, Power, Juſtice, Mercy,</hi> and Sweetneſs, in Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the World, and in contriving and ordering the Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs of Man's Salvation, is far above the reach of our weak Underſtanding; That frequently there is leſs danger in believing too much, than in believing too little; and that there are ſome as ſtrange things related in the <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Scriptures</hi> (at which <hi>Atheiſts</hi> do ſtumble) as are in the approved Hiſtories of the <hi>Church.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Neither do <hi>Catholicks</hi> believe theſe Stories, and their <hi>Articles of Faith,</hi> with one and the ſame cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty: for theſe Stories they believe meerly with <hi>Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Faith,</hi> for the Authority of the Relators, who may Err, miſtake, or deceive: But their <hi>Articles of Faith</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:95768:7"/> they believe with <hi>Divine Faith,</hi> for God's Authority ſpeaking in his Word, and by the ordinary <hi>Doctors</hi> and <hi>Paſtors</hi> of his <hi>Church;</hi> being bound, under pain of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feiting the Name of <hi>Catholicks,</hi> and of incurring damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Sin, not to diſbelieve wittingly, any one of theſe Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles; all of them being <hi>Divine Verities</hi> warranted for <hi>Truth</hi> by the Holy Ghoſt, who continually guideth and directeth the <hi>Church</hi> in her <hi>Doctrine of Faith,</hi> as is hereafter ſhewed out of Gods Word: And ſo by disbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving ſtubbornly the <hi>Articles of Faith</hi> which the <hi>Church</hi> profeſſeth, <hi>Hereſie</hi> is incurred; which is not incurred by diſbelieving her Stories.</p>
            <p>Furthermore, if hereafter I affirm (not for want of Charity, but forced by unanſwerable Arguments drawn from the word of God) that the Followers of the <hi>Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant Religion,</hi> ſo dying, are not ſav'd, take me to ſpeak of thoſe, who culpably prefer this Religion before the <hi>Catholick,</hi> or culpably dye therein, being thereby deſtitute of that <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Charity,</hi> which is of neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty required to Salvation, and not of thoſe, who being truly Baptiz'd, and brought up among <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> have excuſable Ignorance of the <hi>Catholick Faith</hi> and <hi>Church,</hi> by reaſon either of their tender Years, or of their weak Capacities, or elſe of their mean and rude <hi>Education;</hi> for ſuch are ſecret Members of the <hi>Catholick Church;</hi> and therefore if they depart this Life, cloathed with thoſe
<pb facs="tcp:95768:8"/> Garments of Chriſt, with which he adorned them in the <hi>Sacrament</hi> of <hi>Baptiſm,</hi> not having fallen into mortal Sin, they ſhall certainly inherit the <hi>Kingdom</hi> of Heaven.</p>
            <p>In which happineſs, none ſhall be Sharers, that paſs out of this Life deſtitute of <hi>Divine Faith,</hi> which is the Gift of God, (of which more hereafter) or defiled with <hi>Mortal Sin;</hi> which is ſo called, becauſe it deſtroys the ſupernatural life of the Soul (received by <hi>Regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration</hi> in <hi>Baptiſm)</hi> conſiſting in <hi>Divine Faith,</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Celeſtial Virtues; but eſpecially, in Sanctifying Grace and divine Charity; without which Divine Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, nothing doth avail to Salvation, as the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> teaches, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 13.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, becauſe divers <hi>Proteſtant Teachers</hi> endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to make their Followers believe, That the Fathers of the <hi>Primitive Church</hi> were <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> ſeeking thereby to Illuſtrate the <hi>Proteſtant Religion;</hi> that the greatneſs, and boldneſs of this Impoſture (pardon the Word, for I know not how otherwiſe to expreſs truly the dealing of theſe Men) may clearly appear; I humbly intreat all underſtanding <hi>Proteſtants</hi> (which know it not) to take notice, That thoſe ancient Worthies, and Lights of the <hi>Church of Chriſt,</hi> were either <hi>Monks,</hi> or <hi>Founders</hi> of <hi>Monaſtical Diſcipline;</hi> or at leaſt, Approvers and Praiſers of the ſame. <hi>St. Anthony</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:95768:8"/> was a <hi>Monk,</hi> and <hi>St. Athanaſius</hi> his Praiſer. St. <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſil</hi> the Great, a <hi>Monk,</hi> and the Founder of a <hi>Monaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Inſtitute,</hi> which in the Eaſtern part of the World is yet practiſed. St. <hi>Gregory</hi> the Divine, was a <hi>Monk:</hi> St. <hi>Chryſoſtom</hi> a <hi>Monk:</hi> St. <hi>Hierom</hi> a <hi>Monk:</hi> the Great St. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> the Founder of a Monaſtical courſe of Life: St. <hi>Martin</hi> a <hi>Monk:</hi> St. <hi>Benedict</hi> a <hi>Monk,</hi> and Founder of the Famous <hi>Order of Benedictine Monks,</hi> which does yet flouriſh in the <hi>Weſtern Church:</hi> St. <hi>Gregory</hi> the Great was a <hi>Monk;</hi> and by the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours of Fourty <hi>Monks,</hi> did firſt plant <hi>Chriſtianity</hi> amongſt the <hi>Engliſh.</hi> Let any Man judge how likely, or how true it is, that theſe men were <hi>Proteſtants.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> take notice, that theſe <hi>Ancient,</hi> and moſt <hi>Learned Fathers</hi> were great Praiſers and Practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſers of auſtere and penitential works, conſiſting in <hi>fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent Prayer,</hi> in <hi>much watching,</hi> in <hi>ſevere faſting,</hi> in <hi>hard lodgings,</hi> in <hi>courſe and ſpare Dyet,</hi> in <hi>wearing of Hair-cloth,</hi> and the like. They lived ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle Lives. Many of them beſtow'd their Wealth upon the Poor, and other Pious Uſes, and profeſſed <hi>Voluntary Poverty,</hi> following therein the counſel of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> given <hi>Matth.</hi> 19. 21. and they not only allowed of, but alſo moſt highly extolled the obſerving of <hi>perpetual Chaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,</hi> and <hi>Virginity,</hi> preferring the ſame far above <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trimony.</hi> Were not theſe men then ſtrange <hi>Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants?</hi>
            </p>
            <pb facs="tcp:95768:9"/>
            <p> 
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Take notice, that theſe Ancient Worthies, even by the Confeſſion of all <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> were Men of <hi>excellent Wits,</hi> of excellent <hi>Learning:</hi> If then they had found in the word of God (as <hi>Proteſtants</hi> ſay they find) that only <hi>Faith</hi> does Juſtifie; That Good Works are not meritorious: That in Works of Grace Men have not Free-will: That they are not able to keep the Commandments: That it is not in the power of Man or Woman to live perpetually <hi>chaſte:</hi> That <hi>Virginity</hi> is not more pleaſing to God, than <hi>Matrimony:</hi> That to give all to the Poor, to <hi>Faſt, Pray,</hi> and <hi>watch much,</hi> and to undergo other <hi>Auſterities,</hi> and <hi>morti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fications</hi> of the Body, doth not profit and inrich the Soul: That there is no <hi>Purgatory,</hi> no <hi>Pennance</hi> to be done, no <hi>ſatisfaction</hi> to be made for Sin; no <hi>puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> to be inflicted upon the Faithful for them after this Life.</p>
            <p>If, I ſay, the ancient Fathers had found theſe, and the like <hi>Doctrines</hi> of <hi>Proteſtants</hi> in the Scriptures (and why ſhould they not have found them there, if there they had been, they being ſo Wiſe, ſo Learned, and ſo indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrious Searchers of the Word of God, as they were?) If there, I ſay, they had found theſe things, and had believed them as <hi>Proteſtants</hi> do; they would have li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved as <hi>Proteſtants</hi> do; for why ſhould they not?</p>
            <p>If theſe pleaſing Doctrines, which are light and eaſie
<pb facs="tcp:95768:9"/> to Fleſh and Blood, and the ſweet Liberty of the <hi>new Goſpel</hi> had as feelingly pierced, and as ſtrongly poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed the Hearts of thoſe Antients, as it did, and doth the Breaſts and Bowels of <hi>Luther, Zwinglius, Bucer, Peter Martyr, Calvin, Beza,</hi> and their Fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers, the Teachers of the <hi>Proteſtant Religion;</hi> they would, without all doubt, with theſe, have pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred <hi>Pleaſures</hi> before <hi>Pennance; Feaſting</hi> before <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting;</hi> the delights of the <hi>Conjugal Life</hi> before the <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent</hi> and <hi>ſingle;</hi> And in a word, <hi>Riches, Honours, Pleaſures,</hi> before the <hi>labours</hi> and <hi>ſmart</hi> of a <hi>peniten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial</hi> and <hi>mortified Life;</hi> before <hi>voluntary poverty,</hi> and the <hi>vexing Attire</hi> of <hi>Hair-cloth,</hi> or elſe they had been mad: had they believed as moſt <hi>Proteſtants</hi> do, that ſuch Exerciſes as theſe are needleſs, fruitleſs, yea, and <hi>ſuperſtitious Toys.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But the Truth is, that thoſe ancient and ſhining Lamps of <hi>Wiſdom</hi> and <hi>Sanctity,</hi> did not believe as <hi>Proteſtants</hi> do, and therefore they liv'd not as they do; for they were otherwiſe inſtructed in the School of <hi>Chriſt;</hi> they read, and learned another Leſſon in his Divine Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, even the ſame that <hi>Papiſts</hi> now do, and therefore they inſtituted their Lives, as they did; and were in very deed as much <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> as the <hi>Pope</hi> and his <hi>Prieſts</hi> and <hi>Fryers</hi> now are, and no more, moſt certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; unleſs we will have them to have been Sots and Mad-men.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:95768:10"/>
            <p> If a douzen <hi>Proteſtant Miniſters</hi> now, ſhould con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſociate themſelves together; and ſhaking off the Delights of the World, ſhould apply themſelves fervently to much <hi>Prayer, Faſting, Watching, lying on hard Couches,</hi> wearing of <hi>Hair-cloth,</hi> and ſuch other auſterities of Body; and forbearing to <hi>marry,</hi> ſhould highly extol the <hi>ſingle Life, perpetual Chaſtity,</hi> and ſhould exhort <hi>young Maidens, Noble Gentlewomen,</hi> Princes <hi>Daughters,</hi> to the <hi>perpetual keeping of their Virgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,</hi> and <hi>Conſecrating</hi> of it to God; would they be held for ſincere and well-grounded <hi>Proteſtants?</hi> I think not. Nay, would they not preſently be ſuſpected for <hi>Papiſts?</hi> No doubt but they would: the inſtitute of their Life plainly breathing <hi>Papiſtry,</hi> and wholly ſwerving from the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief and practiſe of Learned <hi>Proteſtants.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Let not then, my Noble and dear Countrymen, the miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reports of ſome of your Teachers, ſo far prevail with you, as to make you believe (the better to keep and quiet you in <hi>Proteſtantiſm,)</hi> that the Fathers of the <hi>primitive Church</hi> were <hi>Proteſtants.</hi> For certainly thoſe Bleſſed Servants of <hi>Chriſt</hi> were as far from being <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> as the moſt zealous of your Teachers are from being <hi>Papiſts,</hi> yea, from being <hi>Monks</hi> or <hi>Fryers,</hi> and from inſtituting their Lives, as thoſe <hi>Ancients</hi> did. If then you truly prize the <hi>Learning</hi> and <hi>Sanctity</hi> of the <hi>Primitive Church</hi> and <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> become of that Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief
<pb facs="tcp:95768:10"/> which their Lives and Practices do Preach unto you. If you think them ſaved, be not ſo hardy as to ſeek a new way to Heaven; for the ſafety of your Souls, is of greater moment, then ſo to be expoſed to hazard (being there can be but one ſaving Faith, as my Tenth Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion will make plain unto you.) <hi>Eternal Glory</hi> is not eaſily to be ſet upon the Dice, when you may take a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure way to it. Become then of the <hi>Communion of that Church,</hi> in which the <hi>Fathers</hi> lived and dyed: that therein, ſeconding your Belief with a Virtuous Life, you may aſſuredly attain to everlaſting Happineſs; which I cordially wiſhing unto you, ſhall infinitely rejoice, if theſe my <hi>Queſtions</hi> (which I now leave to your peru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal) ſhall further, or occaſion your return to that <hi>Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,</hi> which aſſuredly leadeth thither. As moſt cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly they will (Gods Holy Grace concurring) if you will but attentively, and with impartial Eyes, read them; and not be ſhuffled off with <hi>frivilous Anſwers;</hi> or reſt ſatisfyed, untill you ſee my Arguments ſolidly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futed; which you will never ſee, if you look well to their Fingers, who ſhall undertake the anſwering of them. And ſo beſeeching God to proſper your Reading and Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation to his own Glory, and the Salvation of your Souls, I remain unfeignedly,</p>

            </p>
            <p>Moreover, out of this Anſwer, it follows, that Chriſt was not the Saviour of the World. For if the World, had no means of Salvation from him, for thoſe five hundred years: Such means it had not from him, the next five hundred years, which paſſed before theſe: Which being granted, it will be hard, if not impoſſible, to prove, either by <hi>Scripture</hi> or <hi>Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,</hi> that for the ſpace of the next five hundred years, which reach up to the times of the <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> the World from Chriſt had any true means of Salvation. And ſo by this Anſwer, he will be wholly excluded, from being the Saviour of the World; as hereafter more clearly ſhall appear.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> No underſtanding <hi>Proteſtant</hi> will deny, that the World was full of <hi>Chriſtians</hi> before <hi>Luther</hi> began his new
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:95768:13"/> Preaching, or that they then had, believ'd, and re-cited the <hi>CREED</hi> of the <hi>Apoſtles.</hi> If then a <hi>Chriſtian</hi> in thoſe times, had been preſs'd by a <hi>Jew, Turk,</hi> or any other <hi>Infidel,</hi> to deny that Article of his <hi>Creed,</hi> I believe a Holy <hi>Catholick Church,</hi> a <hi>Communion of Saints:</hi> Whether might he, with a ſafe Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience have deny'd it, or no? If ſafely he might have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny'd this Article; ſafely alſo he might have deny'd the reſt: In regard that all theſe Articles, ſo far forth as they are the Object of Faith, are of equal Truth and Certainty, as is ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt. For if one of them be falſe, what certainty is there of the reſt? But if he might not without damnable Sin, and the high offence of God, have deny'd this Article, as doubtleſs he might not; then this Article, as well as the reſt, is a <hi>Divine Truth,</hi> which we ought to believe, with firm and Divine Faith: And conſequently there was extant in the World, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Luther</hi>'s riſing, a <hi>Catholick Church,</hi> and a <hi>Communion of Saints:</hi> That is, a common union or conjunction of Sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy'd People in that Church. Otherwiſe Chriſtian People, could not ſo ſtrictly have been oblig'd, to believe that Article: For they cannot be oblig'd to believe a Falſehood. Chriſt (then in the Ages immediatly before <hi>Luther,</hi> began to Preach, and inſtitute the <hi>Proteſtant Church</hi> and <hi>Religion;)</hi> had on Earth a <hi>Catholick Church,</hi> and a Sanctify'd People therein, united together in <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Religion,</hi> and in the participation of his Divine Benefits.</p>
            <p>Which being ſo: What will <hi>Protestants</hi> Anſwer to my <hi>Queſtion?</hi> Will they grant, as the Truth is; that although the <hi>Proteſtant Church</hi> and <hi>Religion,</hi> were no where extant and in practice, the laſt five hundred years before <hi>Luther:</hi> Yet Chriſt had then, and in all former Ages, a ſaving <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Religion?</hi> But then I muſt tell them firſt; That if the <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant Religion</hi> and <hi>Church,</hi> were not then the <hi>Catholick Church</hi> and ſaving <hi>Religion</hi> of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> it cannot prudently be thought, or poſſibly prov'd, to be ſo now. But rather all Diſcreet and Judicious People, muſt hold it to be a new Invention; ſuch as the <hi>Arrian,</hi> or the <hi>Nestorian</hi> Profeſſion was.</p>
            <pb n="3" facs="tcp:95768:13"/>
            <p> 
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> I muſt tell them, that That <hi>Religion,</hi> which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Luther</hi>'s Innovation, was a <hi>Saving Religion,</hi> is ſtill a <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Religion:</hi> For why ſhould it not, it being the ſame that it was? Which being granted; the <hi>Proteſtant Profeſſion</hi> can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be a <hi>Saving Religion:</hi> Becauſe there cannot be two <hi>Saving Religions</hi> extant at the ſame time, oppoſite and contrary one to another (as hereafter more clearly ſhall appear) in regard that one of them, muſt of neceſſity be a <hi>falſe Religion,</hi> and proceed (as from the prime Suggeſtor and Author) not from God, but from the enemy of mankind: Who will never in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent and ſet a foot a <hi>Religion</hi> apt to ſave men in.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> I muſt tell them, that if in all Ages before <hi>Luther</hi>'s time, Chriſt on Earth had a <hi>Holy Church,</hi> and a <hi>Saving Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion;</hi> as moſt certainly he had: The firſt <hi>Proteſtants</hi> did very ill, in forſaking her <hi>Communion,</hi> and in raiſing againſt Her ſuch Factions and Tumults, meerly for Liberty ſake, as they have done: For this breaking off, was not to ſecure their Souls, (whatſoever they pretended, to have ſome colour of their doing;) but to enjoy more <hi>Carnal Liberty,</hi> than the long ſettled Diſcipline of that <hi>Holy Church</hi> could bear, and allow. And as ill do They, who ſtill maintain the ſame breach, and impugne the ſame <hi>Holy Church,</hi> and ſaving Faith of Chriſt: Following <hi>New Inventions</hi> in <hi>Religion,</hi> tending to Liberty: Of which they can never be groundedly ſecure, that they are ſufficient to <hi>Salvation;</hi> as this little Treatiſe doth make too too manifeſt.</p>
            <p>Some <hi>Proteſtants</hi> perchance, being loath to grant, that their <hi>Church</hi> and <hi>Religion,</hi> had no Being at all upon Earth, for the laſt five hundred years before <hi>Luther:</hi> And yet not able to no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minate, with any colour of Truth, where their Church then was, and where their <hi>Religion</hi> was believ'd and practis'd, (there being no Record, or foot-ſtep of theſe things extant in the World) will affirm, that for many Ages before <hi>
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>ther,</hi> their <hi>Church</hi> lay hidden under <hi>Papiſtry.</hi> But how do they know this? Doth the word of God, teach any ſuch thing? If the
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:95768:14"/> 
               <hi>Papiſts,</hi> which then liv'd, did not know of any ſuch thing; or that there was any ſuch <hi>Church:</hi> How do the <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> that now live, know it?</p>
            <p>Certainly this ſaying is too too Childiſh, and fitter for Idiots, or Mad-men, to make, then for men of Judgement: For thereby <hi>Anabaptiſts, Quakers,</hi> new <hi>Arrians,</hi> or any other fooliſh <hi>Hereticks</hi> whatſoever, may pretend, that their <hi>Churches</hi> and <hi>Religions,</hi> were ever extant in all former Ages, and ever in practice in the World, even ſince the times of the <hi>Apoſtles:</hi> Than the which, what can be more ridiculous? My firſt <hi>Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion</hi> then, cannot be ſo Anſwer'd by <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> as may ſatisfy the Conſciences of Prudent men. But let us paſs to the next.</p>

         <div n="2" type="question">
            <head>Queſtion II. <hi>If</hi> Luther <hi>was not the firſt Teacher, of the</hi> Proteſtant Religion;to whom did he immediately ſucceed, in the Office of Teaching the ſame? Where alſo is treated of the <hi>Miſſion</hi> of the <hi>Proteſtant</hi> Teachers.</head>

God? Or the Enemy of God and Man? Not God moſt certainly.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Becauſe nothing can be ſaid, to juſtify the new Teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of <hi>Luther,</hi> which may not be ſaid, to juſtify the new Teaching of <hi>Arius,</hi> or of <hi>Neſtorius,</hi> or of the <hi>Anabaptiſts</hi> and <hi>Quakers,</hi> or of any other falſe <hi>Prophet</hi> and <hi>Heretick,</hi> that ever
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:95768:14"/> was. Let Tryal be made, and this will be found to be moſt true. For by the ſelf-ſame ways, by which <hi>Luther</hi> can prove himſelf, to come from God, any <hi>Heretick</hi> may prove him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to come from God. Will <hi>Luther</hi> ſay that he had a private Inſtinct from God? That he ſaw, there was great need to Reform the <hi>Doctrine of the Church?</hi> That the <hi>People</hi> and <hi>Princes,</hi> who follow'd him, gave him <hi>Calling,</hi> and the like? The ſelf-ſame might <hi>Arius</hi> have ſaid; the ſelf-ſame may the <hi>Quakers,</hi> and <hi>Anabaptiſts</hi> ſay; and the ſelf-ſame may any <hi>Falſe Teacher</hi> ſay, that can get People to follow him.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Becauſe it is certain, that <hi>Luther</hi> had no <hi>Calling,</hi> or <hi>Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion</hi> from God at all: Without <hi>Calling</hi> and <hi>Miſſion</hi> from whom, no man may take upon him the Office of Preaching, and of Paſturing the People of God; as is clear out of his Holy Word, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10. 15. <hi>Heb.</hi> 5. 4. For he came not from God, either by Ordinary, or by Extraordinary <hi>Miſſion:</hi> And ſo he had no ſending from him at all. For God doth uſe no other ſorts of ſending, becauſe no other are fit, to diſtinguiſh the <hi>True Preachers of God,</hi> from the <hi>Falſe Prophets of the Devil.</hi> For <hi>Calling</hi> and <hi>Miſſion,</hi> from <hi>Temporal Magiſtrates,</hi> from the <hi>Common People,</hi> or pretended from private Inſtincts, are agreeable, and common to <hi>Falſe Prophets,</hi> and <hi>Heretical Teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers:</hi> And ſome of theſe, for want of better, when they are urg'd, they ever pretend: But <hi>Ordinary,</hi> or <hi>Extraordinary Miſſion,</hi> they are never able to ſhew.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Extraordinary Miſſion</hi> God doth uſe, when he ſendeth any one to make notable Mutation about <hi>Religion.</hi> But then to aſſure the World, that thoſe, whom He doth ſo ſend, do come indeed from him, he doth ever furniſh them, with the Gift of Heavenly Miracles. Which Gift is as it were His <hi>Broad-Seal</hi> ſet to their <hi>Commiſſion:</hi> Whereby they are eaſily diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh'd, from <hi>Falſe Prophets,</hi> and <hi>Heretical Teachers.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>By this manner of <hi>Miſſion,</hi> God ſent <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Aaron,</hi> and <hi>Chriſt</hi> and his <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> to make thoſe <hi>Mutations</hi> and <hi>Additions</hi> about <hi>Religion,</hi> which they made; furniſhing them with the
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:95768:15"/> Gift of <hi>Miracles,</hi> as is plain out of his Sacred Word. Which Gift was ſo neceſſary, even to the Bleſſed Son of God himſelf, notwithſtanding, the great Sanctity of his Life, and Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency of his Doctrine: The plain Predictions of the <hi>Holy Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets,</hi> and the weighty Teſtimony of St. <hi>John</hi> the <hi>Baptiſt,</hi> that he affirmeth <hi>John</hi> 15. 24. <hi>That if he had not done amongſt the</hi> Jews, <hi>Works that no other had done, they ſhould not have ſinned;</hi> In refuſing Him for their <hi>Meſſias.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Muſt <hi>Luther</hi> then (his Life and Doctrine being ſuch as it was) be receiv'd as ſent from God, by <hi>Extraordinary Miſsion,</hi> to make ſo great a change in <hi>Religion,</hi> as he did, without any <hi>Miracles</hi> at all? Who will think ſo, but inconſiderate, blind, or mad-men?</p>
            <p>But Note here by the way, a thing worth the obſerving: That thoſe, whom God doth ſend, by <hi>Extraordinary Miſsion,</hi> do never exclaim againſt the <hi>Church of God,</hi> and the <hi>Ordinary Paſtors</hi> thereof, which were before their time, as though they had err'd in matters of <hi>Faith,</hi> and abus'd and miſ-led the People of God; as appears by the 23<hi>d.</hi> of St. <hi>Matthew:</hi> But this is ever the Property of <hi>Heretical Teachers,</hi> rais'd up by the Devil, to ſeduce Souls; who always pretend, to Teach the <hi>Church</hi> and <hi>People of God</hi> better than they were taught before. And thereupon they cry out, that the <hi>Church</hi> and her <hi>Paſtors</hi> had Grievouſly Err'd; Till they, forſooth, came, and diſcover'd the <hi>True Light of the Goſpel.</hi> But how Falſe and Fond the proceeding of ſuch men is, will appear by that which follows in the ſequel of this Treatiſe.</p>
            <p>By <hi>Ordinary Miſsion</hi> God doth ſend thoſe, who immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, or in the time of <hi>Succeſsion</hi> mediately, ſucceed (by due <hi>Conſecration,</hi> and <hi>Authorizing)</hi> in the Office of governing (in things Spiritual, and Paſturing the People of God) to them, who were ſent from him by <hi>Extraordinary Miſsion.</hi> In this manner the <hi>Prieſts</hi> of the Law of <hi>Moſes</hi> ſucceeding <hi>Aaron</hi> by Generation, <hi>Conſecration</hi> and <hi>Authorizing,</hi> had <hi>Ordinary Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion</hi> from God, during the time, that That Law was in force.
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:95768:15"/> And in like manner, the <hi>Paſtors</hi> and <hi>Doctors</hi> of the <hi>Law of Grace,</hi> ſucceeding to the <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> by due <hi>Conſecration,</hi> and <hi>Authorizing,</hi> have Ordinary <hi>Miſsion</hi> from God, during the time, that this Law is to be in force: Which is, even till the <hi>Day of Judgement.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Which ſucceed, I ſay, to the <hi>Apostles</hi> by due <hi>Conſecration</hi> and <hi>Authorizing,</hi> that is, by that <hi>Conſecration</hi> and <hi>Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rizing,</hi> which <hi>Chriſt</hi> ordain'd, to confer Divine and Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Power to his <hi>Paſtors.</hi> For this Power being a Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine and <hi>Supernatural</hi> thing, a participation of the Power of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and of Force and Efficacy to <hi>Bind and Looſe Souls,</hi> to <hi>Cleanſe them from Sin,</hi> and to <hi>Sanctifie them;</hi> no Mortal man, though never ſo eminent in <hi>Temporal Magiſtracy,</hi> is able to invent and ordain Means, to give and impart the ſame. And therefore ſtrange and audacious, was their attempt, who in the time of <hi>Edward</hi> the VI. invented a <hi>New Form to Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crate Arch-Biſhops, Biſhops and Prieſts, and to Endue them with Divine and Spiritual Power.</hi> But into this Errour they fell, by the ſingular Providence of God, that thereby <hi>Infinite Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges,</hi> and Abuſes of the <hi>Bleſſed Sacrament,</hi> might be avoid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: Which would have happen'd in <hi>This Kingdom,</hi> if <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant Biſhops</hi> and <hi>Miniſters,</hi> had been <hi>True Prieſts</hi> indeed.</p>
            <p>Out of this Doctrine, which is moſt True, it clearly fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth, that neither <hi>Luther,</hi> nor any other <hi>Proteſtant Teacher</hi> whatſoever, had, or hath any <hi>True Calling</hi> or <hi>Miſsion</hi> from God at all. For manifeſt it is, that none of theſe <hi>Teachers</hi> had <hi>Extraordinary Miſsion</hi> from God: For they could never yet ſhew his Broad-Seal, which is the <hi>Gift of Miracles.</hi> And as manifeſt it is, that they have not <hi>Ordinary Miſsion</hi> from him. For they cannot poſſibly extend the Line of their Succeſſion, beyond <hi>Luther</hi>'s time; or Nominate any <hi>Rank of Paſtors</hi> rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching up, to the <hi>Apoſtles Times,</hi> to whom theſe men do ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed, in the Office of Teaching the <hi>Proteſtant Religion.</hi> Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous then is the ſtate of all <hi>Proteſtants;</hi> becauſe really, and in very deed, they want True <hi>Paſtors</hi> ſent from God.</p>
            <pb n="8" facs="tcp:95768:16"/>
            <p> But ſome will ſay, that the Caſe of <hi>Engliſh Proteſtants</hi> is not ſo bad; becauſe they have <hi>Biſhops,</hi> who have <hi>Ordination</hi> from the <hi>Church of</hi> Rome. I anſwer. <hi>Firſt,</hi> That theſe their <hi>Biſhops,</hi> have indeed a certain ſhaddow of <hi>Ordination,</hi> but not the thing it ſelf; becauſe in their <hi>Ordination,</hi> the ſame Matter and Form is not us'd, by which <hi>Prieſtly Power</hi> is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer'd in the <hi>Roman Church:</hi> But that which was Invented, in the days of <hi>Edward</hi> the VI. and Ratify'd in the time of Queen <hi>Elizabeth;</hi> by which Divine Power cannot be given.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> I anſwer, that if theſe <hi>Engliſh Prelates,</hi> were truly <hi>Biſhops</hi> and <hi>Prieſts</hi> indeed, yet this could nothing avail them, or their Followers: Becauſe this is not ſufficient to <hi>True Miſsion</hi> from God; in regard, that over and above this, true Faculty and Authorizing, (from the <hi>Ordinary Paſtors,</hi> of the <hi>Roman Church)</hi> to Teach and Paſture the People of Chriſt, Succeſſion of Truth in Dogmatical Points is of neceſſity requir'd, to <hi>Ordinary Miſsion</hi> from God. Which Faculty and Authorizing, our <hi>Engliſh Biſhops</hi> wanting, they ſhould thereby be deſtitute of all <hi>True Miſsion</hi> from God, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though they were indeed <hi>True Biſhops;</hi> as it befell the <hi>Arian</hi> and <hi>Nestorian</hi> Biſhops and Prieſts: Which having <hi>True Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation,</hi> and being Truly Biſhops and Prieſts, were notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding deſtitute of all <hi>True Miſsion</hi> from God, being there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of depriv'd by God and his <hi>Church,</hi> in regard of their Rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion againſt the <hi>Church,</hi> and of the falſe <hi>Heretical Doctrine</hi> which they Taught. For Chriſt would have it to be in the Power of the <hi>Paſtors</hi> of his Church, to deprive <hi>Falſe Teachers</hi> of all Authority to Teach, and to expel them out of his Flock, that they might not ruine the Souls of his People.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> I anſwer, That <hi>Proteſtant Paſtors,</hi> cannot have <hi>True Miſsion</hi> from the <hi>Roman Church,</hi> though ſhe would be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtow it upon them: Which ſhe would never do, unleſs they will become <hi>Catholicks,</hi> and will undertake the Teaching, and Re-planting of the <hi>Catholick Religion:</hi> Gods Grace and the care of their own Salvation, and of the Salvation of thoſe
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:95768:16"/> numerous Flocks of People, which follow them, drawing them to enterpriſe ſo <hi>Heroical</hi> and <hi>Divine</hi> a work. Which point I ſhew thus. Either the Paſtors of the <hi>Roman Church,</hi> or the <hi>Paſtors</hi> of the <hi>Proteſtant Church,</hi> are <hi>Falſe Prophets, Falſe Teachers, Falſe Explicators of the Word of God,</hi> and of the <hi>Myſteries of Chriſt:</hi> This is evident; for they cannot be both <hi>Orthodoxal Teachers,</hi> ſeeing they contradict one the other, about many of the Principal Articles of the <hi>Chriſtian Religion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If the Paſtors of the <hi>Roman Church</hi> be Falſe Prophets, and <hi>Heretical Teachers:</hi> They have no <hi>Miſsion</hi> from God them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, being by him prohibited to Teach, as all Falſe Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets are: How then can they impart true and <hi>Divine Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion</hi> to others? But if the Paſtors of the <hi>Proteſtant Church,</hi> be <hi>Falſe Prophets,</hi> falſely Teaching, and Expounding the word of God, and the <hi>Religion</hi> and <hi>Myſteries of Chriſt;</hi> then They are wholly incapable of <hi>True Miſsion,</hi> God himſelf prohibit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them to Teach, becauſe Falſe Doctrine in matters of Faith, doth tend to the ruine of Souls, as is clear out of the Word of God, <hi>Matth.</hi> 7. 15. And ſo the <hi>Roman Church,</hi> if ſhe would, cannot give <hi>Proteſtant Biſhops</hi> and <hi>Miniſters, True Miſsion</hi> and ſending from God.</p>
            <p>Out of the Doctrine deliver'd in this <hi>Queſtion,</hi> which is ſolid and true; it clearly followeth, that the <hi>Proteſtant Religion,</hi> is not truly <hi>Apoſtolick,</hi> that is, deſcending from the <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> and the ſame, that they Believ'd and Taught: Though it pleaſes the <hi>Teachers</hi> thereof, ſo to ſtile it, to make it the more acceptable, to their followers: Even as bitter Pills are ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times Gilt with Gold, that they may the more eaſily be ſwal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low'd. The reaſon is, that this <hi>Religion,</hi> doth not deſcend from the <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> by a continual Line, of <hi>Doctors</hi> and <hi>Paſtors,</hi> one ſucceeding the other, in the Office of Teaching, and practiſing the <hi>Proteſtant Religion;</hi> which reacheth through all Ages, even up to the <hi>Apoſtles.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If any <hi>Proteſtant</hi> will anſwer to this, that they eſteem not their <hi>Religion Apoſtolick,</hi> becauſe it deſcendeth from the
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:95768:17"/> 
               <hi>Apostles,</hi> by ſuch a Line of <hi>Succeſſion:</hi> But becauſe it is ſhap'd out, according to the Model of the <hi>Religion</hi> of the <hi>Apostles,</hi> expreſs'd in the Word of God, ſo near as the Founders and Shapers thereof, could gueſs. I reply firſt, that I will then grant, that the <hi>Proteſtant Religion,</hi> may be ſtil'd <hi>Apoſtolick,</hi> in this ſenſe, when all <hi>Proteſtants</hi> ſhall be agreed among them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, which <hi>Sect</hi> of theirs is beſt ſhap'd out, according to the Model, of the <hi>Apoſtles Religion,</hi> expreſs'd in the word of God, and cometh neareſt to the Purity thereof: That is, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the <hi>Lutherans,</hi> or the <hi>Swinglians,</hi> or the <hi>Calviniſts,</hi> or the <hi>Anabaptiſts,</hi> or the <hi>Quakers,</hi> or the new <hi>Arians,</hi> or the <hi>Parliamentary Proteſtants,</hi> or the <hi>Puritans</hi> have ſhap'd out their <hi>Religion</hi> beſt, and neareſt to the Purity of the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> times. But as they will never be agreed of this, the beſt rule to guide them, in the work of ſhaping out <hi>Religion,</hi> being but the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate gueſs of this, or that <hi>Sect-Maſter,</hi> or <hi>Sect:</hi> So I ſhall never be tyed to grant their <hi>Religion</hi> to be <hi>Apoſtolick.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> I anſwer, that according to this manner of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding, every <hi>Heretick,</hi> will prove his new Devices in <hi>Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,</hi> to be <hi>Apoſtolick:</hi> If he himſelf may be Judge, and may have leave to Senſe and Expound the Scriptures, as his own Gueſs and Conceit ſhall lead him. Which abſurd Liberty being deny'd to <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> they can never prove, even in this Senſe, their <hi>Religion to be Apoſtolick.</hi>

            <head>Queſtion III. <hi>If the</hi> Proteſtant Religion, <hi>be Truly</hi> Catholick: When was it ſpread over the World; and what Heathen Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions hath it Converted to Chriſt?</head>
            <p>IF the <hi>Proteſtant Religion</hi> be truly <hi>Catholick,</hi> as the <hi>Teachers</hi> thereof do ſtile it; it is now, and in former Ages muſt have been ſpread over the World. For Chriſt, as <hi>Daniel</hi> foretold, <hi>c.</hi> 2. <hi>Was to grow into a Mountain,</hi> that is, into a Church, which is his <hi>Myſtical Body, that was to fill the whole Earth.</hi> And as the Royal Prophet Sung, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 2. He was to have <hi>the Gentiles for his Inheritance, and the ends of the Earth for his Poſſeſsion.</hi> The Chriſtians alſo of all Ages, were bound to believe a <hi>Catholick Church,</hi> according to the <hi>Creed of the Apoſtles,</hi> as I before ſhew'd. Which being ſo; if <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants</hi> have been this <hi>Catholick Church,</hi> and their <hi>Religion,</hi> the moſt common and <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſal Religion,</hi> believ'd over the World: They muſt have ſpread themſelves and their <hi>Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion</hi> over the World, by Converting Heathen Nations to Chriſt: according to the clear Promiſes of God made to the <hi>Patriarchs,</hi> that in their Seed, that is, in Chriſt, all the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the Earth ſhould be Bleſſed: (Which Promiſes you ſhall find in my tenth Queſtion) and according to the words of Chriſt, <hi>Matth.</hi> 24. ſaying, <hi>This Goſpel of the Kingdom ſhall be Preached in the whole World, for a Teſtiomny to all Nations: And then ſhall come the Conſummation:</hi> That is, the end of the World.</p>
            <p>Now then, I demand of <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> what Heathen Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, in this, and in former Ages, they have Converted to the <hi>Belief</hi> and <hi>Practice</hi> of their <hi>Religion,</hi> and have thereby ſpread the ſame over the World, as the True <hi>Catholick</hi> Faith of
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:95768:18"/> Chriſt ought to be ſpread? If they cannot truly name any ſuch Nations, as indeed, they cannot, unleſs they will feigne: Let them confeſs, as the certain Truth is, that their <hi>Religion</hi> is neither Truly <hi>Catholick,</hi> but ſo term'd, to delude the ſimple; nor the true <hi>Faith of Chriſt,</hi> by which in him the Nations of the Earth are to be Bleſſed. Let each Prudent <hi>Proteſtant,</hi> who truly ſeeks Salvation, thoroughly weigh this Point.</p>

            <head>Queſtion IV. <hi>What likelihood there is, that to bring to paſs, and effect, the great and Merciful work, of the Converſion of the Nations of the Earth; and of their Kings, to Chriſt, God hath never yet made uſe of the</hi> True Religion of Chriſt <hi>and of the Pure Light of his Goſpel.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>IT is certain out of the Word of God, alledg'd in the laſt Queſtion, that Chriſt was to have the <hi>Gentiles for his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance, and the ends of the Earth for his Poſseſsion,</hi> as the <hi>Royal Prophet</hi> foretold, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 2. 8. That is, He was to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy falſe <hi>Religions,</hi> and the Worſhip of Falſe Gods, and of the Devil, through the World; and to introduce his own Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine and moſt <hi>Holy Religion,</hi> and the True Worſhip of one God amongſt the Nations of the Earth: Thereby to bring un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them, the Bleſſing Promiſed, <hi>Gen.</hi> c. 12. c. 22. c. 26. c. 28. and <hi>Pſal.</hi> 71.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>2ly.</hi> It is alſo certain, that Chriſt was to enter upon this his Inheritance, and to begin the ruine of <hi>Idolatry,</hi> and the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion of the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> by the Preaching of his <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> within ſome few years after his <hi>Aſcenſion:</hi> As is clear out of the Commiſſion, which he gave them, <hi>Matth.</hi> 28. ſaying, <hi>Go,</hi>
               <pb n="13" facs="tcp:95768:18"/> 
               <hi>Teach all Nations;</hi> and out of the words of St. <hi>Paul, Act.</hi> 13. ſaying to the <hi>Jews, To you it behoov'd us firſt to ſpeak the Word of God: But becauſe you repel it, and judge your ſelves unworthy of Eternal Life; behold we turn to the</hi> Gentiles; <hi>for ſo our Lord commanded us: I have put thee to be the Light of the</hi> Gentiles; <hi>that thou mayeſt be Salvation unto the utmoſt of the Earth,</hi> Iſaias 49.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> It is certain, that although the Converſion of the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> was to be begun by the <hi>Apoſtles;</hi> yet it was not to be compleatly finiſh'd by them; but was to be continued by their <hi>Succeſſors</hi> the <hi>Doctors</hi> and <hi>Paſtors</hi> of the Church, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4. 12. And not to be accompliſh'd till toward the end of the World; as is clear out of Gods word, <hi>Matth.</hi> 24. Where our Saviour being ask'd a Sign of his coming to <hi>Judgement,</hi> and of the end of the World, gave the compleat Preaching of his Goſpel to all Nations, for a ſign thereof, ſaying, <hi>This Goſpel of the Kingdom ſhall be Preached in the whole World, for a Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony to all Nations, and then ſhall come the Conſummation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This alſo is manifeſt out of <hi>Iſaias,</hi> by whom God foretold the converſion of the Kings of the Earth to Chriſt his Son, and their lowly ſubjection to his <hi>Church,</hi> ſaying, <hi>v.</hi> 7. <hi>c.</hi> 49. <hi>Kings ſhall ſee, and Princes ſhall ariſe and Adore for the Lords ſake.</hi> And again, <hi>Kings ſhall be thy Nurſing Fathers, and Queens thy Nurſes: With Countenance caſt down toward the ground they ſhall Adore thee, and they ſhall lick the Duſt of thy feet.</hi> And <hi>c.</hi> 60. <hi>Thy Gates ſhall be open continually, day and night they ſhall not be ſhut, that the ſtrength of the Gentiles may be brought to thee, and their Kings may be brought: For the Nation and the Kingdom, that ſhall not ſerve thee, ſhall periſh.</hi> And a little after, ſpeaking again of the Church of Chriſt gather'd out of the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> he ſays, <hi>For that thou waſt forſaken</hi> (viz. in the time of the Law of <hi>Moſes) and hated, and there was none that paſs'd by thee, I will make thee to be the pride of Worlds, a joy unto Generation and Generation: And thou ſhalt ſuck the milk of the Gentiles: And thou ſhalt be Nurſed with the Teats of Kings.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="14" facs="tcp:95768:19"/>
            <p> Out of which clear Propheſies, it ſeems to be manifeſt, that the chief Converſion of the <hi>Gentiles</hi> was to be effected, long after the times of the <hi>Apoſtles:</hi> When the <hi>Roman Empire,</hi> the ſtrength then of the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> in the time of <hi>Conſtantine</hi> the Great: And in the following Ages the Kings and Princes of <hi>Spain, France, England, Scotland, Ireland, Denmark, Norway, Swedeland, Poland, Hungary,</hi> and of other Countries, were Converted to the Faith of Chriſt, and wonderfully Honour'd and Inrich'd his <hi>Church;</hi> as the <hi>Laws</hi> of exemption, which they made, or receiv'd, the Edifices which they Built, and <hi>Biſhopricks</hi> and <hi>Monaſteries</hi> which they Founded, and Endow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, do abundantly teſtify. For in the Apoſtles days, and ſome Ages after, was rather fulfill'd the Prediction of Chriſt, foretelling <hi>Luke</hi> 21. That his Diſciples and Servants ſhould be <hi>Hated before Kings and Preſidents,</hi> and ſhould be Deſpis'd, Perſecuted, and Kill'd by them.</p>
            <p>Which things being ſo, I demand of Prudent and Conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> what probability there is, that to bring to paſs the Divine and Merciful work, of the Converſion of the Nations of the Earth, and of their Kings to the Chaſte and Holy Faith of Chriſt, and to the Worſhip of the true God, from the Impure Service of Falſe Gods, and deteſtable Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of the Devil. God hath never made uſe of the <hi>True Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion of Chriſt,</hi> and of the Pure Light of his Goſpel; (if the <hi>Proteſtant Profeſsion</hi> be Chriſt's <hi>True Religion,</hi> and the Pure Light of his Goſpel) but hath ever made uſe, to effect this admirable work, of his Power and Mercy, of the Blind and Superſtitious Religion of the <hi>Papiſts?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That God for the ſpace of above a thouſand years, in the Converſion of <hi>Heathen</hi> Nations and their Kings, hath ever made uſe of <hi>Papiſtry,</hi> is evident, out of the Hiſtories of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer times, which relates the Converſion of Nations. Yea, even in theſe latter times, in which, ſince the riſing of the <hi>Proteſtant Religion,</hi> the Faith of Chriſt, hath been infinitely ſpread in the <hi>Eaſt</hi> and <hi>Weſt-Indies,</hi> and in divers vaſt <hi>Iſlands</hi>
               <pb n="15" facs="tcp:95768:19"/> of the Sea, amongſt Heathen and Barbarous Nations: God hath utterly neglected the <hi>True Religion,</hi> and the pure Light of the Goſpel, that is, the <hi>Proteſtant Religion:</hi> And hath made uſe only of <hi>Papiſtry,</hi> to make theſe Nations Bleſſed in Chriſt. Now is not this a very likely thing, if <hi>Papiſtry</hi> be a Falſe, and <hi>Proteſtancy</hi> the True <hi>Religion?</hi> As likely, certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly it is, as that the Sea doth burn, as that the Sun is dark, and Snow black.</p>
            <p>For (to ſpeak plain <hi>Engliſh)</hi> If <hi>Proteſtancy</hi> be <hi>Gods Religion,</hi> and <hi>Papiſtry</hi> the Devils, in regard, that God cannot in very deed, be Author of both theſe <hi>Religions,</hi> they being oppoſite, and contrary one to the other: How can God neglect the <hi>Proteſtant Religion,</hi> and make uſe of <hi>Papiſtry,</hi> to ſpread the Faith of his Son over the World, to make thereby the Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the Earth Bleſſed in him? Nay, how can they be made Bleſſed in Chriſt, by the help of the <hi>Devils Religion?</hi> How can it become the Wiſdom and Goodneſs of God, to neglect his own <hi>Religion,</hi> and to ſpread, increaſe and exalt the Devils? To neglect the <hi>True Light of the Goſpel,</hi> and to delude the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the Earth, with the Superſtitions of <hi>Papiſtry?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Who then is ſo ſhort and dim ſighted, that he doth not ſee, that even from hence is moſt clearly prov'd, that the <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant Profeſsion,</hi> is not <hi>Gods Religion,</hi> is not the Pure Light of the Goſpel, ordain'd by God, to give Light to the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> and to make them Bleſſed in Chriſt: But a late and new In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention ſuggeſted by the Enemy of God, to deſtroy in theſe <hi>Northern</hi> parts of the World, that Religion which God made uſe of heretofore, to root out Him and his <hi>Idolatrous Worſhip;</hi> and to make theſe Nations Bleſſed in his Son?</p>
            <p>I conclude then this <hi>Queſtion</hi> with this Syllogiſm: That is <hi>Gods Religion,</hi> and the <hi>True Goſpel,</hi> and <hi>Doctrine of Chriſt,</hi> which is Preached over the World, to ſpread therein the Name and <hi>Faith of Chriſt,</hi> for a Teſtimony to all Nations. But <hi>Papiſtry,</hi> and not <hi>Proteſtancy,</hi> is ſo Preach'd over the World: <hi>Ergo Papiſtry,</hi> and not <hi>Proteſtancy,</hi> is <hi>Gods Religion,</hi>
               <pb n="16" facs="tcp:95768:20"/> and the <hi>True Goſpel,</hi> and <hi>Doctrine of Chriſt.</hi> The <hi>Major</hi> is certain, and clear out of the Words of Chriſt, <hi>Matth.</hi> 24. above-related. The <hi>Minor</hi> is certain, and alſo clear out of the Hiſtories of former Times; and alſo of this preſent Age. The concluſion follows well. And ſo it reſts demonſtrated, that the <hi>Holy Catholick Roman Faith,</hi> Nick-nam'd <hi>Papiſtry,</hi> is <hi>Gods Religion,</hi> and the <hi>True Goſpel of Chriſt.</hi> Which will appear yet more clearly out of the <hi>Queſtions</hi> following.</p>
         </div>
         <div n="5" type="question">
            <head>Queſtion V. <hi>Whether it be not a very inconſiderate thing, and full of danger, to prefer, in matters of</hi> Faith <hi>and</hi> Religion,the Teaching of Men, before the Word of God?</head>
            <p>ALthough the Arguments of the precedent <hi>Queſtions,</hi> be firm, and ſtrong, and ſufficient, to make Conſiderate <hi>Proteſtants</hi> to look about them; yet many of them, will be little mov'd therewith; becauſe they are poſſeſs'd with a ſtrong imagination, that <hi>Their Religion</hi> is grounded upon the word of God, is ſquar'd out thereby, and wholly, or at leaſt very much cleans'd, from the Doctrines of men: To free them from which falſe and dangerous Conceit and Perſwaſion: I here demand.</p>
            <p>Whether it be not a thing of great Inconſideration, and of no ſmall danger, to prefer, in matters of <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Religion,</hi> the Teaching of Men, the Doctrine of This, or That <hi>Preacher,</hi> before the <hi>Word of God?</hi> Yea, in effect, to hazard and pawn ones Soul, that the Teaching of theſe, or thoſe new Maſters, is truer, and rather, to be follow'd, than the expreſs word of God it ſelf?</p>
            <pb n="17" facs="tcp:95768:20"/>
            <p> This will ſeem to <hi>Proteſtants</hi> a ſtrange demand, becauſe they eſteem <hi>Papiſts</hi> not a little culpable, for relying too much upon the <hi>Doctrines of Men:</hi> And therefore they will here bid me, take my ſelf by the Noſe. Nevertheleſs, whatſoever they imagine, I will eaſily here free <hi>Papiſts,</hi> and prove them guilty of preferring the Doctrines of Men, before the expreſs Word of God.</p>
            <p>That <hi>Papiſts</hi> are not guilty of this Crime, is clear enough. <hi>Firſt,</hi> Becauſe no Text of the Word of God, taken in its proper Senſe, (and as the Antient Fathers, the general Councels, the ever viſible <hi>Catholick Church</hi> of Chriſt, did take it,) doth directly contradict, any Article held by the <hi>Roman Church.</hi> For example, no Text doth ſay, that we are not juſtify'd, by <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Good-Works:</hi> That Works of Grace done in the ſtate of Grace are not Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritorious: That the <hi>Body of Chriſt</hi> is not really in the <hi>Holy Euchariſt:</hi> That <hi>Lawful Prieſts,</hi> have not Power (as Gods Inſtruments) to <hi>Abſolve</hi> from Sins rightly Confeſs'd: That no <hi>Satisfaction,</hi> is neceſſarily requir'd on our Parts: That there is no <hi>Purgatory:</hi> That it is not Lawful, or Profitable to Pray to <hi>Saints,</hi> to Honour them, as Sanctify'd Creatures, to reſpect Reverently their <hi>Reliques;</hi> to have <hi>Holy Pictures,</hi> and Reverently to regard them, for the Love of Chriſt, or his Saints; and the like. No Text, I ſay, of the Word of God, doth expreſly condemn Theſe, and the like Articles believ'd by <hi>Catholicks:</hi> Though many make expreſly for them, as <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick Divines</hi> do ſhew.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> Although all True <hi>Catholicks,</hi> do Humbly and Obediently believe, as the <hi>Church</hi> Teaches: And thereupon do firmly imbrace divers Articles propos'd by Her, which are not, in expreſs Terms, found in the <hi>Scriptures:</hi> Yet in theſe very Points, they do not believe the <hi>Doctrines of men,</hi> or prefer the <hi>Doctrines of men,</hi> before the expreſs <hi>Word of God;</hi> or hazard their Souls, that the Teaching of Their Paſtors, is truer, or rather to be follow'd, than the Word of God: But
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:95768:21"/> in theſe particular Articles, they rely upon the Authority of God, and believe the Word of God, ſpeaking in, and by his Church; which will not be hard to ſhew.</p>
            <p>For the Office of Preaching the Word of God, by Chriſt committed to his <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> dy'd not with them, but continu'd with their <hi>Succeſſors.</hi> And ſo the Preaching of their <hi>Succeſſors,</hi> was the Preaching of the Word of God, not only in the firſt Age after the <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> but in all ſucceeding Ages, the Holy Ghoſt <hi>Ever abiding with them,</hi> John 14. And <hi>Teaching them all Truth,</hi> in matters of Faith, <hi>John</hi> 16.</p>
            <p>Moreover, in the Ages after the Apoſtles, not only thoſe who had Skill and Means to Read the Scriptures: But thoſe alſo, who could not Read them, might believe in Chriſt, and might be Saved by him: And conſequently they might have true Faith in him: Which they could not have, but by <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving the Word of God:</hi> The Apoſtle ſaying <hi>Rom.</hi> 10. <hi>Faith is by Hearing, and Hearing is by the Word of Chriſt.</hi> Whilſt ſuch then Heard and Believ'd <hi>The Doctrine of the Church;</hi> that is, the Teaching of the Doctors and Paſtors of the Church, they Heard, and Believ'd the Word of God: The ſame do <hi>Papiſts</hi> now.</p>
            <p>Futhermore, it cannot be doubted, but that the Goſpel and Voice of Chriſt, is the Word of God; and that thoſe, which hear theſe, hear the Word of God. But the Preaching and Teaching of the Doctors and Paſtors of the Church of Chriſt, is the Goſpel and Voice of Chriſt, <hi>Ergo,</hi> &amp;c. This is clear out of <hi>Matth.</hi> 24. where Chriſt ſays, <hi>This Goſpel of the Kingdom ſhall be Preach'd in the whole World, for a Teſtimony to all Nations, and then ſhall come the Conſummation.</hi> For who do Preach this Goſpel, in all Ages, till the end of the World, but the <hi>Doctors</hi> and <hi>Paſtors of the Church?</hi> Their Preaching then is the Goſpel of Chriſt, and conſequently the Word of God. Chriſt likewiſe ſays, <hi>John</hi> 10. ſpeaking of his Sheep, which he is to gather out of the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> even till the end of the World: <hi>Other Sheep I have, which are not</hi>
               <pb n="19" facs="tcp:95768:21"/> 
               <hi>of this Fold,</hi> (that is, of the Flock of the <hi>Jews;) Them alſo I muſt bring, and they ſhall hear my Voice.</hi> Chriſt did not, nor doth not Preach to the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> to gather his Sheep from amongſt them, in all Ages, by his own Corporal Voice: But by the Voice and Teaching of the Paſtors of his Church. Their Voice then is his Voice, and conſequently the Word of God.</p>
            <p>Which is yet further ſhew'd out of <hi>Luke</hi> 10. where Chriſt ſays to his Paſtors, and Teachers: <hi>He that heareth you, heareth me.</hi> Wherefore while <hi>Papiſts</hi> do hear the Teaching, of the <hi>Doctors</hi> and <hi>Paſtors</hi> of the Church, lineally ſucceeding the <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> they hear the <hi>Word of God,</hi> the <hi>Goſpel of Chriſt,</hi> the <hi>Voice of Chriſt;</hi> yea, <hi>Chriſt himſelf.</hi> And therefore they cannot be juſtly ſaid, to believe, in matters of Faith, the Doctrines of men: Or to hazard their Souls upon the Doctrines of men: But upon the Authority of God ſpeaking in, and by that Church, which his continual aſſiſtance maketh to be, <hi>The Pillar and ground of Truth,</hi> 1 Tim. 3.</p>
            <p>But the Caſe is not ſo with <hi>Proteſtants:</hi> For they do not only rely, and hazard their Souls, upon the Doctrines of Men: But they alſo prefer the Doctrines of men, before the expreſs Word of God. For in divers moſt weighty Points of <hi>Religion,</hi> they leave, not only the Antient Fathers, the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Councils, and the ever viſible and <hi>Catholick Church</hi> of Chriſt, but even the Word of God it ſelf, to follow the Teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of their new Maſters. This will ſeem at firſt a ſtrange, or rather a very Injurious, and Contumelious Imputation: But let us make it plain by ſome examples.</p>
            <p>The Word of God, ſays <hi>James</hi> 2. 24. <hi>Do you ſee that a man is juſtify'd by Works, and not by Faith only?</hi> But <hi>Proteſtant Teachers</hi> ſay, that a man is juſtify'd, <hi>Not by Works, but by Faith only.</hi> Mark how directly, they contradict the Word of God. For that ſays, <hi>By Works, and not by Faith only.</hi> And theſe do <hi>Proteſtants</hi> believe, rather than the expreſs Word of God, in the weighty point of <hi>Juſtification:</hi> On which their Salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on depends; which is not obtain'd, but by the true manner of Juſtification.</p>
            <pb n="20" facs="tcp:95768:22"/>
            <p> 
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> The Word of God, ſays, <hi>Luke</hi> 1. 6. That the Parents of <hi>John</hi> the <hi>Baptiſt, Were both Juſt before God, walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in all the Commandments and Juſtifications of our Lord with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out blame.</hi> Whence it clearly follows, that this Holy Couple kept all Gods Commandments. For he that breaks them, doth not <hi>Walk in them without blame.</hi> The Word of God likewiſe ſays, 1 <hi>John</hi> 5. 3. <hi>This is the Charity of God, that we keep his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments, and his Commandments are not heavy.</hi> But <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant Teachers</hi> generally affirm, that the Commandments of God, <hi>are Impoſſible,</hi> are ſuch as <hi>no man can keep,</hi> are <hi>Inſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portable:</hi> And confequently they muſt ſay, that no man is bound to keep them. For no man is bound to do more than he is able. By which Doctrine, they do not only looſe the Bridle to all Vice, and make God more Indiſcreet, and more Tyrannical, than any other Commander in the World: But They alſo flatly contradict the word of God: Which not only ſhews, that ſome men have kept the Commandments, but alſo expreſly affirms, that they are not Heavy. And yet <hi>Proteſtants</hi> rather believe theſe, than the Word of God in this moſt weighty point. But Note well, what follows, againſt theſe Teachers, out of the Word of God, 1 <hi>John</hi> 2. 4. Which there ſays, <hi>He who ſaith he knows God, and does not keep his Commandments, is a Lyer, and the Truth is not in him.</hi> But <hi>Proteſtant Teachers</hi> affirm, that they rightly know God, but do not, nor cannot keep his Commandments, <hi>Ergo,</hi> They are Lyars.</p>
            <p>Our Saviour Inſtituting the <hi>Holy Euchariſt,</hi> ſays, <hi>Luke</hi> 22. 19. <hi>This is my Body which is given for you.</hi> But <hi>Engliſh Miniſters</hi> generally ſay, That the <hi>Euchariſt</hi> is not <hi>Chriſt's Body,</hi> which was given for us; that is, his True Body: But a Figure, or remembrance of it. Chriſt ſays, <hi>My Body, which is given for you:</hi> That is, my True Body. For his True Body was given for Us, ſuffer'd for Us, and not a Figure or Remembrance thereof. But theſe new Teachers ſay, <hi>Not his True Body; not that, which was given for <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>s, that ſuffer'd for <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>s:</hi> But a Figure of it, which the Word of God no where Teaches.
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:95768:22"/> And thus they flatly contradict the <hi>Word of God,</hi> in this moſt important Article of Faith: On the right Belief, and Uſe of which, Salvations depends, as is manifeſt out of the 6 St. <hi>Joh.</hi> and out of the 11. of the 1 of <hi>Corinthians.</hi> And yet Theſe our <hi>Engliſh Proteſtants</hi> believe, rather than the Word of God, though it expreſly ſays, That the <hi>Euchariſt</hi> is the <hi>Body of Chriſt,</hi> The <hi>Fleſh of Chriſt;</hi> He himſelf ſaying, <hi>John</hi> 6. 51. <hi>The Bread which I will give, is my Fleſh for the Life of the World.</hi>

The VVord of God ſays, <hi>In the days of thoſe Kingdoms, the God of Heaven will raiſe up a Kingdom</hi> (that is, the Church of Chriſt) <hi>that ſhall not be diſſipated for ever: And his Kingdom ſhall not be deliver'd to another people. And it ſhall break in pieces, and ſhall conſume all theſe King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms; and it ſhall ſtand for ever.</hi> Of which Church of Chriſt ſpeaking again, <hi>c.</hi> 7. He ſaith, <hi>His Power is an Eternal Power, that ſhall not be taken away; and his Kingdom, that ſhall not be corrupted.</hi> Conformable to which clear Prophecy of <hi>Daniel,</hi> concerning the Perpetuity and Incorruption of the Kingdom, and Church of the <hi>Meſſias;</hi> Chriſt ſpeaking of his Church, <hi>Matth.</hi> 16. ſays, <hi>And the Gates of Hell ſhall not prevail againſt her.</hi> That is, The Power of the Devil, and falſe Doctrines, by which men are ſeduc'd, and brought to Hell. <hi>John</hi> 14. 16. He ſays, That the Holy Ghoſt ſhould <hi>Abide with his Apoſtles for ever.</hi> That is, with them and their <hi>Succeſſors,</hi> the Doctors and Paſtors of his Church: For they were not in their own Perſons to abide for ever with the Church to Teach and Guide her. And <hi>John</hi> 16. 13. He ſays, That the ſame Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Spirit, ſhould <hi>Teach them all Truth.</hi> In reſpect of whoſe continual abode with the Church, to Teach her, in matters of <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Religion, All Truth:</hi> St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſtiles her 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. 15. <hi>The Pillar and ground of Truth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But <hi>Proteſtant Teachers</hi> ſay, that the Church of Chriſt <hi>Hath been Corrupted: That the Gates of Hell,</hi> that is, the Devil and his Inſtruments, <hi>Have prevail'd againſt her,</hi> and have fill'd
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:95768:23"/> her with Pernicious Errors, and Superſtitions, for above theſe thouſand years: That the Holy Ghoſt, hath not taught her <hi>All Truth;</hi> but hath given place to the Devil, permitting him, to repleniſh her, with Errors and Superſtitions, to the ruine and loſs of Infinite Chriſtian Souls: That <hi>She is not the Pillar and ground of Truth:</hi> But the receptacle and ſink of falſhood. And thus they directly contradict the Word of God, about this prime and moſt important Article, of the Truth and Incor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption, of the <hi>Church of Chriſt,</hi> in matters of <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion:</hi> And yet <hi>Proteſtants</hi> rather believe Them, than the clear Word of God; ſo much doth draw and blind, the Love of <hi>Novelty</hi> and <hi>Liberty.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But they will ſay, we leave not the Word of God, to follow the Teaching of Men: But to follow the right meaning of the Word of God, deliver'd unto Us by our Teachers. I anſwer, <hi>Firſt,</hi> Have you juſt cauſe to think, that theſe your <hi>Teachers,</hi> who have neither Unity, nor Sanctity, nor <hi>Antiquity,</hi> nor the Gift of <hi>Miracles,</hi> nor any true Calling and ſending from God, do rather deliver unto you, the right meaning of the Word of God, than the Antient Fathers, General Councils, and ever <hi>Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible Church of Chriſt</hi> guided by the Holy Ghoſt? I believe not.</p>
            <p>I Anſwer, <hi>Secondly,</hi> That you are miſtaken. For you leave the Word of God, to follow the Interpretation of your Teachers. Which Interpretation, is not Gods Word, but their Word, their Conceit, their Doctrine, and Explication of Gods Word: To follow which, you leave, as I have ſhew'd, the expreſs Word of God. And therefore moſt true it is, that you leave the Word of God, to follow the <hi>Doctrines of Men:</hi> If your Teachers be men.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> I anſwer, That, if Affection did not make your Judgements miſcarry, you might eaſily ſee, that the Doctrine of your Teachers (being ſo directly contrary to the VVord of God) cannot be the meaning thereof. For God in his Sacred VVord, Ordain'd to inſtruct, and not to delude us, and in his profound Myſteries, doth not uſe to ſpeak one thing, and to
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:95768:23"/> mean the clean contrary: To ſay that the <hi>Euchariſt is his Body,</hi> and to mean, <hi>That it is not his Body,</hi> but a Figure of it: To ſay, that men <hi>are juſtify'd by Works, and not by Faith only:</hi> And to mean, that they <hi>are not juſtify'd by Works, but by Faith only.</hi> For this manner of dealing is fitter for a Jugler, than for God: And if the ſame be once allow'd of, what fooliſh, wicked, damnable Hereſie can there be, that may not be thus defended by Scripture? Or what Articles of the <hi>Chriſtian Faith</hi> may be firmly prov'd out of the <hi>Word of God,</hi> if wilfull, head-ſtrong, <hi>Preſumptions Teachers,</hi> may in this ſort Expli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate, Delude and Contradict, the clear, plain, and Literal Senſe thereof?</p>
            <p>If any one deſire, to ſee more places of Gods word, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradicted in this manner, by <hi>Proteſtant Teachers,</hi> let him look in the Induſtrious Collation of Doctor <hi>Smith,</hi> formerly <hi>Biſhop of</hi> Calcedon; and he ſhall there find demonſtrated to his Eye, that theſe men, by their new Doctrine, do oppoſe the expreſs VVord of God, in above two hundred Points of <hi>Religion,</hi> now Controverted betwixt the <hi>Catholicks</hi> and them: So far off they are, from Teaching the Pure VVord of God, as they make their Credulous Followers believe: And ſo wide their Doctrine is, from being the True Light of the Goſpel, as they uſually ſtile it. VVhereas in very deed, it is only their own new Interpretation of the Goſpel; not the Goſpel it ſelf: As is evident by the multitude of <hi>Sects,</hi> which are amongſt them: Some being <hi>Lutherans,</hi> others <hi>Swinglians,</hi> others <hi>Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptiſts,</hi> others <hi>Calviniſts,</hi> others new <hi>Arians,</hi> others <hi>Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers,</hi> ſome <hi>Puritans,</hi> ſome <hi>Arminians,</hi> ſome <hi>Parliamentary Proteſtants,</hi> and the like: VVhich could not happen, if all their Teachers, indeed did follow the VVord of God, (that being but one) and not their ſeveral Explications, and Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretations of it. VVhence it doth clearly appear, that the ſtate of <hi>Proteſtants</hi> is moſt dangerous: Becauſe, in thoſe Points of <hi>Doctrine,</hi> in which they differ from the <hi>Old Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,</hi> inſtead of following the VVord of God, they meerly follow the VVord of Men.</p>

            <head>Queſtion VI. <hi>Whether God hath left to Chriſtian People, any ſure Rule of Faith, any certain Guide in matters of</hi> Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion; <hi>any Infallible Interpreter of his Word?</hi>
            </head>
            <p>TO diſcover to <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> the true Root of their Diviſion into ſo many <hi>Sects,</hi> I demand of them, whether they have any certain <hi>Rule of Faith,</hi> or no? That is, whether they have any ſure and un-erring Guide to Direct them, in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of Faith, to the right meaning of the VVord of God: Any Infallible Propoſer of their <hi>Articles of Faith:</hi> Any un-erring Director, in the profound Myſteries of the <hi>Chriſtian Religion,</hi> and in the practice of the Worſhip of God? If they have none of theſe: How can their Faith be certain? If it be uncertain, doubtful, wavering, as indeed it is, for want of a ſure Rule to guide it by: With what Prudence may Chriſtian People hazard their Souls therein?</p>
            <p>If <hi>Proteſtants</hi> have any certain <hi>Rule of Faith,</hi> why do not the Learned of their <hi>Churches,</hi> make uſe thereof, to agree and attone the <hi>Controverſies</hi> which are among them? That they are divided into ſuch ſeveral Branches, as I a little before nam'd, cannot be deny'd. That they jar, and contend about weighty <hi>Points of Religion,</hi> is manifeſt. For they differ a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout <hi>Predeſtination,</hi> the <hi>Cauſe of Sin,</hi> the <hi>Redemption of Chriſt,</hi> his <hi>Deſcending into Hell,</hi> his <hi>Aſcenſion up to Heaven,</hi> and <hi>ſitting at the Right-hand of God,</hi> his <hi>Equality with his Father,</hi> the <hi>Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizing of Infants,</hi> the <hi>Real Preſence, of the Body and Blood of Chriſt, in the Euchariſt, Church Government, Ceremonies,</hi> and like. Which to be weighty matters, and ſuch as wring the Conſcience, beſide the Nature it ſelf, of theſe things, is clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſhew'd, by the Reluctation of our <hi>Engliſh Non-conformiſts.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="25" facs="tcp:95768:24"/>
            <p> But, to avoid the Diſgrace of uncertainty, in <hi>Matters of Faith,</hi> ſome <hi>Proteſtants</hi> will ſay, that they want not a <hi>Sure Rule,</hi> to ſquare out their Faith by: For the Scripture to them, is a certain and Infallible Guide. But to manifeſt how de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fective this Anſwer is; I demand, whether the Scripture of it ſelf, or Interpreted, be a ſure <hi>Rule of Faith?</hi> If of it ſelf, without the help of an <hi>Interpreter,</hi> it be ſuch a <hi>Rule:</hi> Why have not all, that read it, one and the ſame <hi>Faith?</hi> Why do not all believe the ſelf ſame <hi>Articles,</hi> and <hi>Divine Verities,</hi> if the <hi>Scripture</hi> it ſelf, clearly and diſtinctly propoſe them to all? Where the Rule is certain, all that is meaſur'd by it, is Uniform, and of the ſame quantity: As is manifeſt by a <hi>Pound,</hi> by a <hi>Quart,</hi> by an <hi>Ell,</hi> by a <hi>Buſhel,</hi> and the like. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore if the <hi>Scripture</hi> of it ſelf, without the help of any <hi>Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preter,</hi> be unto Men, a <hi>ſure Rule,</hi> a certain and ſtinted mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of Faith; it doth to all, that Read or Hear it, meaſure ſhape, and ſquare out, one and the ſame <hi>Belief,</hi> one and the ſame <hi>Religion,</hi> one and the ſame <hi>Worſhip of God.</hi> But this is evidently falſe: <hi>Ergo,</hi> evidently alſo falſe it is, that the <hi>Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi> of it ſelf, without the help of an <hi>Interpreter,</hi> is a <hi>ſure Rule and Guide,</hi> in matters of <hi>Faith.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For what is more manifeſt, then that <hi>ſeveral Readers,</hi> left to the guidance of the <hi>Scripture it ſelf,</hi> and not tyed to any <hi>Interpreter,</hi> do gather out of it, ſeveral and oppoſite <hi>Faiths</hi> and <hi>Religions,</hi> though they uſe all Humane Diligences, to underſtand them rightly, and be never ſo Learn'd, never ſo well skill'd in the <hi>Greek</hi> and <hi>Hebrew</hi> Tongues? This is evident, by the ſeveral branches of <hi>Proteſtants</hi> before-nam'd: Who all take the <hi>Scripture</hi> it ſelf, (as they ſay and pretend) for their Guide and Director, in matters of <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Religion:</hi> And yet they differ and contend ſo infinitely as they do. Which differing and contending, we muſt not conceive to ſpring in them, meerly from <hi>Malice,</hi> and the <hi>Spirit of Contention:</hi> But rather from the Obſcurity of the <hi>Scripture,</hi> and the depth and profundity, of the Myſteries therein contain'd: In which our weak under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtandings
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:95768:25"/> may eaſily miſtake; and may eaſily be deluded by the Devil, if we want the help of a ſure and <hi>Infallible Interpreter.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This I think, underſtanding <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> will not deny. And therefore, if they will have the <hi>Scripture</hi> to be a <hi>Sure Rule,</hi> to direct their <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Religion</hi> by, will they, nill they, they muſt admit of, and adjoyn to the <hi>Scripture,</hi> a ſure, un-erring and Infallible <hi>Interpreter</hi> thereof: But ſuch an one, it is impoſſible for them to find, unleſs they will leave the <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant,</hi> and return to the <hi>Catholick Faith</hi> again: For ſeeing they reject the Interpretation of <hi>Fathers,</hi> of <hi>Councels,</hi> of the <hi>Ordinary Doctors</hi> and <hi>Paſtors of the Church:</hi> And hold, that the <hi>Church of Chriſt</hi> may err, yea, and hath ſhamfully and perniciouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly err'd, for above theſe thouſand years; where will they find an <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>n-erring Interpreter</hi> of the Scripture? Or in whom hath God plac'd this high, moſt neceſſary, and moſt important Office?</p>
            <p>If he hath not placed it, in the Doctors and Paſtors of his Church, which he hath ordain'd to <hi>Perfect his People,</hi> and to <hi>keep them from wavering</hi> in matters of Faith, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4. And which the Holy Ghoſt hath plac'd in the Flock of Chriſt, Act. 20. <hi>To govern the Church of God:</hi> Hath he placed it in the <hi>Temporal Magistrates,</hi> of <hi>Kingdoms</hi> and <hi>Common-wealths?</hi> Or in ſome one <hi>Temporal Magiſtrate,</hi> to whom God hath committed the Teaching, and directing of all Nations? If God hath not placed this moſt needful Office in <hi>General Councels</hi> conſiſting of the <hi>Learned Sages</hi> and <hi>Prelates of the Church;</hi> hath he plac'd it in the <hi>Parliaments</hi> of <hi>England;</hi> conſiſting for the moſt part of unlearned Lay-men? I think no <hi>Sober Proteſtant</hi> will ſay ſo.</p>
            <p>Neither will any <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtanding Proteſtant,</hi> I think, fly here to the private Spirit: And make thereby every Crack-brain'd Scripturiſt, an <hi>Infallible Interpreter of Gods Word.</hi> For if hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he fly, not only a <hi>Quaker,</hi> an <hi>Anabaptiſt,</hi> a <hi>Presbyterian,</hi> but a <hi>Taylor</hi> alſo, a <hi>Button-maker, Weaver,</hi> or <hi>Cobler,</hi> will make his Party good, with any Doctor the <hi>Proteſtants</hi> have, and dart Text for Text with him, for whole Hours together, without looſing one Inch of ground: Till <hi>Church Authority,</hi>
               <pb n="27" facs="tcp:95768:25"/> the deadly Weapon of the <hi>Papiſts,</hi> be urg'd againſt him. By urging which againſt theſe <hi>Fanatick People, Proteſtant Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates,</hi> do not a little, or ſleightly Wound themſelves; they being as blame-worthy indeed, if not much more; for reſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Authority of the <hi>Catholick Church of Chriſt,</hi> as theſe are, for reſiſting the Authority of the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Nevertheleſs I approve not, but deteſt the Male-peart bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, of theſe and the like Ignorants: Who, tranſgreſſing the bounds to them preſcrib'd, and entring upon, (to their own Perdition,) the ſmoaking mount of the Holy Scriptures <hi>Exod.</hi> 19. wherein God doth ſpeak to <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Aaron,</hi> and deliver his Sacred Oracles, to be by them made known to his People,) dare take upon them to interpret the ſame, and to ſearch into, and Senſe the <hi>Profound Myſteries of God,</hi> wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly betrampling with their Impure Feet, and Polluting with their baſe Conceits, thoſe pure but deep Fountains of Heavenly Verities: It being their Duty to Learn, and not to Teach. Yet I cannot but pitty their <hi>Miſlead Zeal:</hi> Which if it were ſteer'd by the <hi>True Church of Chriſt,</hi> would Inrich their Souls with the precious Jewels of many <hi>Chriſtian Virtues;</hi> whereas now it is likely to be the utter ruine of them.</p>
            <p>Neither can I but greatly blame thoſe, who to draw theſe weak and unwary People off, and to ſeperate them from the Breaſt of the <hi>Catholick Church:</hi> (At which they were ſecure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly nouriſh'd, with the Milk of <hi>Celeſtial Doctrine,</hi> Meat be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiting their ſtate and Weakneſs,) did put the <hi>Bible</hi> into their Prophane Hands, inviting them to the <hi>Goſpel,</hi> to the Pure Light and Liberty of the <hi>Goſpel:</hi> And aſſuring them that thoſe Sacred Volumes were eaſie to be underſtood, and that in them they were to ſeek for the Truth of <hi>Gods Religion,</hi> as being or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain'd by him, for the Reading and Inſtruction of all. And to facilitate this deſir'd ſeparation; thoſe <hi>New Teachers,</hi> ſpar'd not to Diſgrace with all Art and Cunning, the Rank and Dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of the <hi>Prelates of the Church,</hi> and to Vilify <hi>Church-Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority;</hi> Proclaiming it to be Tyrannical: And that to urge
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:95768:26"/> men to believe, as the Church doth Teach, was no leſs than plain Butchering of Conſciences.</p>
            <p>But when theſe New Maſters, had effected, what they ſought; and by the help of <hi>Temporal Power,</hi> had brought Multitudes of People under their Command: Then preſently they ſtept into the place of the <hi>Antient Prelates:</hi> Took their Authority upon them, and in matters of <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Religion,</hi> would have all to dance after their Pipe, all to believe, not what they themſelves Learn'd out of the Book of God, but what theſe men thought fit to propoſe: That Book now be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing too hard, for Vulgar People, for the Unlearn'd ſort. Who now muſt ſtand below, and not aſcend, and enter upon that obſcure and ſmoking Mountain: But muſt hear <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Aaron;</hi> muſt hear Authoriz'd <hi>Teachers;</hi> muſt obey the voice of the <hi>Church, viz.</hi> Of <hi>Saxony,</hi> of <hi>Geneva,</hi> of <hi>England;</hi> and muſt follow in <hi>Saxony</hi> one Faith, in <hi>Geneva</hi> another, in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> another. Now they muſt learn the Law of God, from the mouth of Teachers allow'd of by the Commonwealth, and be ty'd to believe what they propoſe.</p>
            <p>And therefore in <hi>Saxony,</hi> they muſt not budge from <hi>Luther;</hi> in <hi>Geneva</hi> from <hi>Calvin,</hi> in <hi>England</hi> from the Belief Eſtabliſh'd by <hi>Parliament:</hi> Which if they do, preſently they are urg'd, and ſometimes born down by <hi>Church Authority:</hi> Preſently ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent and pithy Sentences, extolling <hi>Church Authority,</hi> and ſhewing the Neceſſity thereof, are Alleadg'd, Magnify'd, urg'd in <hi>Sermons,</hi> in Books, out of the Scripture, out of <hi>Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tullian,</hi> St. <hi>Cyprian, Lirinenſis,</hi> and other Fathers: Notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding that theſe very Sentences, through the ſides of theſe poor Ignorants, do deadly ſtab the Hearts, of thoſe which alleadge them, for diſobeying that very <hi>Church Authority,</hi> which theſe Sentences ſpeak of, and commend.</p>
            <p>But with what Equity, (if I may be ſo bold as to ask) with what Security of Conſcience, do theſe <hi>Authoriz'd Teachers,</hi> proceed againſt theſe Zealous Ignorants, for following that Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief, which they gather out of the Word of God, put into their
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:95768:26"/> Hands, by theſe their <hi>Teachers,</hi> and force them to follow ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, which by the very Rules and Tenets of theſe men, they cannot but eſteem <hi>Superſtitious?</hi> May they not juſtly ſay: If the Scripture only be the <hi>Rule of Faith,</hi> why do ye not permit us to believe, what we find therein? If it be eaſie to be underſtood, why do you puniſh us, for holding that Doctrine, which we gather out of it? If it be not eaſie, why do you put it into our Hands? If we are not bound to believe, in <hi>Points of Faith</hi> any thing, that is not expreſly in the <hi>Scripture,</hi> why will ye force us to believe and practice that, which there we find not?</p>
            <p>If <hi>Church Authority</hi> is to be rejected, why do you interpoſe yours? If it be a Butchering of Conſciences, to force men to <hi>Believe,</hi> as the <hi>Church</hi> doth Teach; Why do you force us to <hi>Believe</hi> as you Teach? If you contemn the Authority, of the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ver Viſible <hi>Church,</hi> why do you force us to Reverence, and to ſtoop to yours? What ſignes do you ſhew, what Miracles do you work, to demonſtrate unto us, that your <hi>Church Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority</hi> is rather to be Follow'd, rather to be Obey'd, than the <hi>Church Authority</hi> of the Antient Fathers, of the <hi>General Councels,</hi> of the ever Viſible <hi>Church of Chriſt?</hi> If <hi>Church Authority</hi> be to be Follow'd, be to be Reverenc'd, be to be Obey'd, Reſtore Us to that, which Hoary <hi>Autiquity,</hi> which <hi>Succeſſion of Prelates,</hi> which <hi>Conſent of Nations,</hi> which <hi>Excellent Sanctity,</hi> which <hi>Manifeſt Miracles</hi> do commend unto Us. If it is to be rejected, leave us to Gods Word, and force not our Conſciences againſt that Light, which ſhineth unto us, in Reading the ſame.

            <p>PErchance ſome <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> not able to give a ſatisfying <hi>Anſwer</hi> to my <hi>Question,</hi> about the Interpreter of the Scriptures, will affirm, That God hath not ordained any cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain <hi>Interpreter</hi> of thoſe his Sacred Oracles: but hath left them to the ſcanning, and gueſs of all Readers whatſoever. But then I demand, How it can be defended, that theſe Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Books are not hurtful; yea, and even pernicious to Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind? For evident it is, that they may be taken in divers, and oppoſite Senſes: Yea, evident it is, that they are <hi>de facto</hi> ſo taken, by ſeveral Learned Men. Who, following no ſurer Interpreter, than the ſtrength of their own Wit and Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; do gather out of them, contrary <hi>Faiths</hi> and <hi>Religions,</hi> and ſeveral worſhips of God: Of which ſome of neceſſity muſt be falſe, and hurtful to all that follow them; for <hi>Falſe Religions</hi> are ever hurtful, yea plainly pernicious, to thoſe which follow them; as more clearly hereafter ſhall ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear.</p>
            <p>And indeed three things are queſtionable about the Holy Scriptures, which, without the help of an un-erring <hi>Interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi> authorized, and enabled by God himſelf, to guide us to the Truth about them, can never be rightly, and fittingly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cided. The firſt is, <hi>Which Books are Canonical, and truly the Word of God: And which are not?</hi> The ſecond is, <hi>Which Tranſlation is good, right, authentical; and which is not?</hi> The third is, <hi>Which is the true and right meaning of the Holy Ghoſt,</hi>

Which they being not able every where to find by their own natural Forces, without the help of a ſure <hi>Interpreter,</hi> directed by the Holy Ghoſt: They will pick out divers falſe Senſes; yea, and Religions, out of the Scriptures, by miſtaking their right meaning: Which they will repute the true meaning of them, (being not tyed to any Interpreter,) and will defend Tooth and Nail, to the aſſured Perdition of their own Souls, and theirs, whom they draw after them; and to the raiſing of ſeveral Factions, endleſs Contentions, and bloody Broils amongſt Chriſtian People; as we ſee fallen out ſince the riſing of <hi>Luther.</hi>

            <p>For each of thoſe, who thus ſearch the Scriptures, without regarding any <hi>Infallible Interpreter,</hi> will eaſily perſwade him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, that is the right meaning of the Holy Ghoſt, which he hath lighted upon, and that, the true <hi>Light of the Goſpel,</hi> which ſhineth to him, in reading and ſcanning the Word of God; and that therefore it ſtandeth him upon, if he will not betray the Truth, and loſe his own Soul, to ſtick firmly there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto; and to ſtrive even to death to maintain the ſame: Yea, ſometimes ſuch Searchers of God's Word, eſteem them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves bound in Conſcience, to bandy with all the force they can, againſt thoſe, who ſeek to Ruine, what they would Raiſe. From which manner of perſwaſions, have proceeded, not only great varieties of <hi>Religions,</hi> and great Animoſity in the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of them; but all the furious Garboils alſo, and bloody Contentions about <hi>Religion,</hi> which now for above theſe Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred Years have miſerably turmoil'd the <hi>Chriſtian World;</hi> and

            </p>
            <p>Which Root of Diſſention is no other thing than that liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, to Read and Interpret the Holy Scriptures, which the <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testant Religion</hi> inſtilleth into Men; while it denieth the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibility of the Church,</hi> admitteth of no certain, and un-erring <hi>Judge of Controverſies,</hi> to whoſe definitive Sentence, all are bound to ſubmit; and maketh the written Word of God, of it ſelf, without an <hi>Interpreter,</hi> the ſole <hi>Rule of Faith;</hi> by which all Men ought to ſquare out their <hi>Belief</hi> and <hi>Religion.</hi>

            </head>
            <p>ALL underſtanding <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> will eaſily grant, that no <hi>Family, City, Kingdom, Commonwealth, Army,</hi> or <hi>Navy,</hi> can be fittingly, and rightly ordered, and govern'd, without ſome Head, or Supream <hi>Magiſtrate,</hi> to whom <hi>Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects</hi> may have recourſe; and from whom they may receive Directions, as need ſhall require. Which being ſo, I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of <hi>Protestants,</hi> whether the State in Earth of the Great <hi>Family, City, Kingdom, Commonwealth, Army</hi> of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> that is, his <hi>Church,</hi> doth of neceſſity require, for the fit Uniform and peaceable Government thereof, a Supream Head, a Supream Spiritual Magiſtrate, to whom the Subjects thereof may have Recourſe, and from whom they may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>receive Directions, in matters of <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Religion,</hi> as need ſhall require?</p>
            <p>To deny the Neceſſity of ſuch a Supream Magiſtrate, for the fit Government of the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Christ,</hi> conſiſting of Men, yea, of ſo many ſeveral Nations, differing in Laws, Cuſtoms, Affections, Empire, and the like, is manifeſtly againſt Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon. And to affirm, that although ſuch a Magiſtrate be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamly needful, for the due Government of His Church, yet he neglected to provide Her of any ſuch, is to accuſe him of want of Wit and Diſcretion, for there was never yet a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt Civil People, ſo ſimple a Founder of a <hi>Commonwealth,</hi> or ſo ſimple a <hi>Law-maker,</hi> that ordained no Supream Power in his <hi>Commonwealth,</hi> no <hi>Interpreter</hi> of his Law, no <hi>Judge</hi> to decide and end <hi>Controverſies.</hi> Chriſt then being Founder of
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:95768:29"/> the beſt Commonwealth that ever was, and maker of the beſt Law that Mankind ever received; it can be no leſs than Blaſphemy, to affirm, that he left this his Noble <hi>Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth</hi> without a Supream Magiſtrate, to whom his People might have recourſe; and his <hi>Divine</hi> and <hi>Evangelical Law</hi> containing ſo many obſcure Verities, ſo many profound Myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, without an Interpreter, without a Judge, to decide, and end <hi>Controverſies.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Moreover, If Chriſt hath ordained no ſuch Supream Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate, Head or Guide of his Church, in things Spiritual, appertaining to Faith and Religion, it ſeems to follow clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and manifeſtly, that every man is at liberty to believe what he liſt, and to practiſe what Worſhip of God he thinks beſt. What Unity then in Faith, what Uniformity in the Worſhip of the Divinity can there be in the <hi>Church of Chriſt?</hi> Or what ſure means have Chriſtian People to know who be right and who <hi>Heretical Believers?</hi> Or to diſcern their true <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates,</hi> whom they are bound to obey, <hi>Heb.</hi> 13. 17. from Falſe Prophets, from <hi>Heretical Teachers,</hi> whom they are to ſhun, under pain of Damnation? <hi>Matth.</hi> 7. <hi>Tit.</hi> 3. Yea, How can any man be proved to be a falſe Teacher, if there be not ſome known true Teacher? If no man hath Power and Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority from God to direct the Faith of others. If no man be bound and obliged by Chriſt to Believe, or to Teach as an other would have him, how can any man be juſtly eſteemed to Believe or Teach amiſs? Or why ſhould he be reputed to Believe or Teach amiſs, if he be not bound to limit and ſquare out his Faith and Teaching, by the Judgement and Diſcretion of ſome other?</p>
            <p>Wherefore, either we muſt ſay, that the <hi>Church of Christ</hi> is not to be obeyed, that falſe Prophets are not to be avoided, that no man doth Believe or Teach amiſs, ſo long as he Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieves and Teaches well in his own Judgement; and that no man is, or can be, in reſpect of Men, an <hi>Heretick,</hi> or a <hi>falſe Prophet:</hi> All which is contrary to the Word of God, and
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:95768:29"/> plainly overthroweth all <hi>Chriſtianity;</hi> or elſe we muſt affirm, as the certain Truth is, that God hath ordained and appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſome to teach and to direct others, what they ought to Believe and Practiſe to obtain Life everlaſting; and others to be taught and guided.</p>
            <p>What will <hi>Proteſtants</hi> to this? Will they deny all poſſibility of <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity</hi> and of <hi>Order</hi> in the Church and Family of Chriſt? or elſe will they grant (as Reaſon, and as the Truth requires,) that God hath ordained ſome viſible <hi>Miniſterial Head,</hi> ſome Supream Spiritual Magiſtrate in his Church, to whom all may have Recourſe in the Affairs of <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,</hi> and by whom all are bound to be directed in Points of <hi>Faith,</hi> and in the Practiſe of his <hi>Divine Worſhip?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If this they grant, I demand which is this Head, this <hi>Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Magistrate,</hi> and in whom doth reſide this Supream Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Power and Authority? Doth it reſide in <hi>Supream Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual,</hi> or in <hi>Supream Temporal Magistrates?</hi> If in <hi>Supream Temporal,</hi> doth it reſide in one, or in many? If in one, who is this <hi>Supream Temporal Magiſtrate?</hi> Who hath Power and Authority, even by <hi>Gods Ordination,</hi> to direct the whole World, all the Nations of the Earth, in matters of <hi>Faith,</hi> and in the Practiſe of Gods Worſhip? And how is this proved out of the Word of God?</p>
            <p>If this <hi>Supream Power</hi> reſide not in any one <hi>Supream Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral Magiſtrate;</hi> Doth it by Gods Ordination, reſide in many, that is, in the <hi>Supream Temporal Magiſtracy</hi> of each Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth, in ſuch ſort, that the <hi>Supream Temporal Magiſtrate,</hi> Prince or King of each Commonwealth or Kingdom, hath Power and Authority from God to direct the Subjects thereof in <hi>Faith,</hi> and to appoint them what <hi>Religion</hi> they ſhall follow, what Worſhip of God they ſhall practiſe? If ſo, then the Subjects of each Commonwealth are bound, under Pain of Damnation, even by Gods Ordination, to be of that <hi>Religion</hi> which their <hi>Supream Temporal Magiſtrate</hi> will have them.</p>
            <pb n="36" facs="tcp:95768:30"/>
            <p> And ſo, where ſuch a <hi>Supream Magiſtrate</hi> is a <hi>Catholick</hi> (that is, a <hi>Papiſt,</hi> according to the Stile and Language of <hi>Proteſtants,)</hi> his Subjects are bound to be <hi>Papists,</hi> if ſo be he will have it.

            <p>Where note by the way, The late hard and harſh Dealing of ſome <hi>Engliſh Protestants,</hi> toward their <hi>Catholick Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours,</hi> whom they termed Traytors, often vex'd and afflict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and eſteemed worthy of all Puniſhments, becauſe they would not believe and practiſe that <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Religion,</hi> for True and Divine, which it hath pleaſed this Commonwealth to Frame (not out of the <hi>Holy Scriptures, Antient Fathers, General Councils,</hi> and <hi>Perpetual Tradition of the Church,</hi> but out of the Doctrine of <hi>Luther, Melancthon, Suinglius, Peter Martyr, Calvin,</hi> and the like, who in their Riſing, Calling, Proceeding, were as like <hi>Arius, Pelagius, Nestorius,</hi> and other former <hi>Hereticks,</hi> as one Egg is like another) which I ſay, it hath pleaſed this <hi>Commonwealth</hi> to frame, and to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe; though <hi>Catholicks</hi> cannot ſo do, without incurring the high Offence of God, and certain Peril of their own Souls; becauſe they are perſwaded in their own Conſciences, that
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:95768:30"/> to imbrace or profeſs the <hi>Proteſtant Religion,</hi> is a damnable Sin, in regard that the Profeſſion thereof, is the Profeſſion of a <hi>Falſe Religion,</hi> (which is ever damnable to the Conſcious Profeſſor) and the denial of the True, that is, of the only Right and Saving Faith of Chriſt; which <hi>Catholicks</hi> hold to be no other than the Antient, and commonly received Faith of the <hi>Chriſtian World,</hi> not raſhly, and upon ſlight, but af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſerious Conſideration, and upon firm and ſure Grounds, as every judicious man may eaſily perceive, at leaſt in part, out of that which this little Treatiſe doth preſent him.</p>
            <p>Hard then, and much to be pity'd, was the late Conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of <hi>Engliſh Catholicks;</hi> who either truly and really muſt have been Traytors to Chriſt, and ruine their own Souls, or elſe they muſt have expoſed themſelves to be reputed, by their <hi>Mis-inform'd Neighbours,</hi> Refractory, Diſobedient, Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure and Trecherous to their Prince; a thing, to all good <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholicks,</hi> moſt Hateful, moſt Deteſtable, and muſt have run the Hazard to looſe their <hi>Goods</hi> and <hi>Liberties,</hi> and have laid open to the Malice of <hi>Spiteful Neighbours,</hi> to the Spleen of Furious Proteſtants, to the Railing of Slanderous Predicants, to the baſe Vexation of Purſevants, and to the Depilations of Promoters, and of other Under Officers. To theſe Miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries I ſay, <hi>Innocent Catholicks</hi> have been expoſed, till it hath pleaſed God to raiſe up a good <hi>Joſiah,</hi> our Gracious Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign, <hi>James</hi> the Second, to Protect them, and to extend his bountiful Favour toward them.</p>
            <p>But to ſpin out the Thread begun, if it be contrary both, to <hi>Scripture</hi> and <hi>Reaſon,</hi> ſo to enſlave <hi>Religion,</hi> to the Check of Temporal Lords, that Subjects muſt believe as it ſhall pleaſe them to appoint. We muſt admit that Supream Power to Guide and Direct in Matters of Faith, doth immediately reſide in certain <hi>Spiritual Rulers, Prelates,</hi> and <hi>Magistrates,</hi> even by the peculiar Ordination of God. Which being ſo, I demand of <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> whether this Power, by Gods Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dination, reſideth in one, or many? This I ſay, I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:95768:31"/> of <hi>Protestants,</hi> in regard that of the right knowledge of this Point, doth depend the right knowledge of the <hi>True Goſpel</hi> and <hi>Religion</hi> of Chriſt, which we cannot learn, but of thoſe Doctors and <hi>Paſtors</hi> whom God doth ſend and Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoriſe to Teach.</p>
            <p>What then will <hi>Proteſtants</hi> anſwer to this <hi>Queſtion?</hi> what will they anſwer? Much, no doubt; but not much to the purpoſe, becauſe they are not yet agreed among themſelves about this Point; for the <hi>Lutherans</hi> will have this Power to reſide in their Teachers; but the <hi>Calviniſts</hi> in theirs. The <hi>Anabaptists</hi> will have it reſide in their Congregation; but the <hi>Quakers</hi> in theirs. The <hi>Engliſh Proteſtants</hi> will have it reſide in their <hi>Biſhops</hi> and <hi>Parliaments;</hi> but the <hi>Puritans</hi> will have it to be in their <hi>Conſistorian Elders.</hi> And ſo none of theſe can make a ſatisfying Anſwer to my <hi>Queſtion,</hi> all of them diſagreeing as they do, and no one <hi>Sect</hi> of them having bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Grounds out of Gods Word than the reſt. For I demand, Firſt,</p>
            <p>In whom did this Power reſide, the laſt five hundred years before <hi>Luther?</hi> If it were then in any <hi>Proteſtant Doctors,</hi> let them be named, and let it be ſhewed out of good Records, whether they were <hi>Lutherans</hi> or <hi>Calviniſts.</hi> But if no ſuch Doctors can de named, as certainly they cannot, becauſe there were none ſuch, and that this Power did then reſide in other Teachers; how came any ſort of <hi>Proteſtant Doctors</hi> to have this Power afterwards? here nothing can be ſaid for <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> that may not as rightfully be ſaid for <hi>Arians, Neſtorians,</hi> or any other <hi>Hereticks</hi> whatſoever.</p>
            <p>Secondly, I demand, Whether this Power reſide in one, or in many? If in one, who this one among <hi>Protestants</hi> is? If in many, who theſe many are, and whether they have any viſible Head among them or no, to whom all the reſt are bound to ſtoop, and to ſubmit their Judgements in the Deci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of Controverſies about <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Religion,?</hi> If they have no ſuch Head, what Hope of <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity in Faith,</hi> and of
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:95768:31"/> 
               <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niformity</hi> is there in the <hi>Service</hi> and <hi>Worſhip of God?</hi> certainly none at all, as evident Experience doth teach, by the Example of the <hi>Lutherans</hi> and <hi>Calviniſts,</hi> and of other <hi>Protestants.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And ſo, while <hi>Protestants</hi> refuſe one <hi>Supream Spiritual Head,</hi> authoriſed and enabled (by the continual Aſſiſtance of the Holy Ghoſt, clearly promiſed in the Word of God) to direct them in Faith, and in the right Worſhip of God, without dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of mis-leading and deluding them; they refuſe in very Deed, not only Unity in <hi>Faith,</hi> and <hi>Conformity</hi> in the <hi>Service of God,</hi> but the true means of Salvation alſo, which Chriſt our Saviour hath ordained for them, within the Communion of his <hi>Catholick Church.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Out of whoſe happy <hi>Communion,</hi> they will not acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge themſelves to be, nor ſee the Danger they are in, till it be too late. Becauſe willing, (without ſearching ſeriouſly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the matter) they repute the <hi>Old Religion</hi> to be ſuch, ſo Vile, Abſurd, and Superſtitious, as the falſe Tongues and Pens of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers of their Teachers (who like to thoſe of <hi>Iſaias</hi> 28. 15. make Lying their Hope, and are protected with Lying) depaint it to be, that ſo, with more tranquility of mind, they may enjoy the Liberty of their <hi>New Religion,</hi> eſteeming the Abſurdities reported of the Old, to warrant them ſufficiently, not only not to look after the ſame, but alſo utterly to hate and deteſt it.</p>
            <p>Yet in a Buſineſs of ſo great importance, as is the Salvation, or Damnation of their Souls, they might remember, that one Tale is good till another be heard; and the rather, for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to their <hi>Noble Progenitors,</hi> and to the numerous Troops of <hi>Bleſſed Souls,</hi> now reigning with <hi>Chriſt in Glory,</hi> which have liv'd and dy'd in the <hi>Old Religion.</hi> But ſeeing that nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Wiſdom and Sanctity of theſe, nor the earneſt Cries of <hi>Catholicks</hi> now living (who continually avouch that <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants</hi> are mis-informed, miſtake, mis-conſtrue, mis-under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand the Tenets and Practiſes of the <hi>Catholick Religion)</hi> can move them to make a ſerious Scarch into <hi>Religion.

               <hi>Religion</hi> is here diſ-eſteem'd, yet the Haters, Impugners, and Oppreſſors thereof, will be of another mind at the <hi>Judgement Seat of Christ,</hi> when their great Account muſt be made, when Pleaſures, Riches, Honours will be paſt, when Obedience to Chriſt and his <hi>Church,</hi> when a Holy and Mortify'd Life will be priz'd, and when the Glorious Troops of <hi>Holy Doctors</hi> and <hi>Paſtors,</hi> and of innumerable other bleſſed Men and Women will ſtand up in Judgement, with great conſtancy, againſt all that have neglected, vilified, contemned, derided their <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, Teaching, Practice, Examples,</hi> as many of the <hi>New Goſpellers</hi> uſually do.</p>

            <head>Queſtion. IX. <hi>Whether the Way to Salvation be narrow, or no?</hi>
            </head>
            <p>IN the Ninth Place, I demand of <hi>Conſiderate Proteſtants,</hi> whether the Way to Salvation be narrow or no? If this happy Tract be not indeed a narrow Way, Why did Chriſt, with a kind of Admiration, ſay, <hi>Math.</hi> 7. 14. <hi>How narrow is the Gate, and ſtraight the Way that leadeth to Life, and how few there are that find it?</hi> Was he deceived? or did he intend to deceive us? if neither, becauſe in very Truth, this Way, to Fleſh and Blood, is narrow, and not to be kept and travelled without much Labour, great Difficulty, and frequent Mortification, both of the Body, by crucifying the Fleſh, and the Concupiſcences thereof, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5. 24. and alſo of the Mind, by ſubjecting the <hi>Will</hi> to the <hi>Laws of Charity,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13. and by bringing the Underſtanding into Captivity, for Obedience to Chriſt, in believing as the Apoſtles and their Succeſſors do teach, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. 5. without ſuffering much for the Love of God, for the Practice of Virtue, for
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:95768:32"/> the avoiding of ſin, and for the Profeſſion of our Faith, if a ſtorm of Perſecution ariſe. If, I ſay, for Theſe, and ſuch like reſpects, the Tract of Salvation be indeed a narrow way, as the Bleſſed Son of God affirms, who beſt knew this matter: How may any <hi>Proteſtant</hi> Prudently perſwade himſelf, that the <hi>Proteſtant Religion,</hi> is really this hard and narrow way; ſeeing that it is one of the eaſieſt <hi>Religions</hi> in the World; one of the wideſt and broadeſt ways?</p>
            <p>For what greater eaſe, and freedom in <hi>Religion,</hi> can there be, than to be ty'd to no ſharpneſs, and <hi>Mortification of Body:</hi> And to be at liberty in Mind, to believe in matters of <hi>Religion,</hi> what we think beſt our ſelves? VVhich liberty moſt certainly all <hi>Proteſtants</hi> have, by the very Tenets and Principles of their <hi>Religion;</hi> which freeth them from being bound (in their own Conceit) to Believe as the Church Teaches: And takes from them, in the ſame manner, the yoke of Faſting, of Confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, of Pennance: Freeth them from all neceſſity of doing good VVorks, to be Sav'd: Yea, and of keeping the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments of God, as moſt <hi>Proteſtants</hi> hold: And Teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth them, to eſteem themſelves juſtify'd from Sin, and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cur'd from all pain, in the next Life, and ſure of Salvation, by only Faith, by Believing only and ſtedfaſtly, that the Lord hath dy'd for them, and pay'd the ſhot of their Sins.</p>
            <p>That this is ſo, not only their <hi>expreſs Doctrine,</hi> but even alſo the Lives of <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> eſpecially of their Teachers and Ring-leaders, do evidently convince. And therefore ſeeing that no doubt can be made, but that the <hi>Proteſtant,</hi> is a moſt eaſie <hi>Religion,</hi> and exceedingly pleaſing to Fleſh and Blood: There can no doubt alſo be made, but that it is not that nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row way, of which our Saviour did ſpeak, which leadeth to Salvation: But rather the broad way, which leadeth to ever-laſting Perdition. VVhat ſatisfying Anſwer to this, <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants</hi> may make, I ſee not. And therefore ſuch of them, as truly deſire to ſecure their Souls, and to avoid everlaſting mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery, may do well and wiſely, to return (whilſt they have

            <head>Queſtion X. <hi>How it can be defended, that</hi> Jeſus <hi>was the True</hi> Meſſiah, promis'd in the <hi>Old Teſtament,</hi> if the Church, which he Founded, err'd ſo many Ages, in her Doctrine of Faith.</head>
            <p>IT is a certain, undoubted, and undenyable Truth, and not to be queſtion'd amongſt Chriſtians, that <hi>Jeſus</hi> the Son of the Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> is the true <hi>Meſſias,</hi> the <hi>True Chriſt</hi> promis'd in the <hi>Old Teſtament,</hi> the <hi>Omnipotent Son of God, Truly God, Truly Man,</hi> and the true and ſole <hi>Redeemer</hi> of the World. This I ſay, is a moſt certain Truth, and not doubted of by any, but wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Miſcreants. Yet to diſcover the Nature of the <hi>Proteſtant Religion,</hi> and to ſhew clearly, to my Dear Countrymen, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it tendeth, that thereby, if they will, they may receive the leſs hurt by it: I muſt crave leave to demand, how this prime and <hi>Fundamental Truth of Chriſtianity,</hi> can be defended, and maintain'd againſt <hi>Atheiſts, Turks</hi> and <hi>Jews,</hi> if we ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit for a Truth; that, That Church, which <hi>Jeſus</hi> founded, and which his <hi>Apoſtles</hi> planted in the World, hath grievouſly and perniciouſly err'd in her <hi>Doctrine of Faith,</hi> and in the practice of the Worſhip of God, for many Hundred years? Yea almoſt even ſince the times of the Apoſtles?</p>
            <pb n="43" facs="tcp:95768:33"/>
            <p> That the <hi>Church of Jeſus</hi> hath ſo Erred, is the Main, Prime, and Fundamental Ground of the <hi>Proteſtant Religion,</hi> as is well <note place="margin">* <hi>The Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Perils of Idolatry.</hi> p. 57.</note> known; For upon This, as upon a ſure Foundation, <hi>Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant Teachers</hi> have raiſed all their New Buildings: Upon this as upon a ſufficient Cauſe, they have forſaken the <hi>Old Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,</hi> of the Chriſtian World, pretending it to be <hi>Erroneous, Superſtitious, Idolatrous,</hi> and have undertaken their various, and diſcordant <hi>Reformations;</hi> about which they themſelves cannot yet agree. Which being ſo; to Demonſtrate clearly that this prime Ground of the <hi>Proteſtant Religion,</hi> and general Tenet of all <hi>Proteſtant Teachers,</hi> doth directly lead, yea, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>evitably force, (if it be throughly looked into, and ſearched to the bottom,) to the denyal of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and all <hi>Chriſtia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I lay for my Firſt Ground, That without <hi>Faith in Jeſus Chriſt, no Man can be ſaved.</hi> This is not only the Belief of all, that wear and deſerve the Noble Title of a Chriſtian, but certain alſo out of the Word of God. <hi>Act.</hi> 4. 12. <hi>There is not Salvation in any other; for neither is there any other Name un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Heaven given to Men,</hi> (to wit, but the Name of Jeſus,) <hi>wherein we muſt be ſaved.</hi> Mark 16. 16, <hi>But he that ſhall not believe,</hi> (namely, the Goſpel, and Religion of Chriſt,) <hi>ſhall be condemned.</hi> Heb. 11. 6, <hi>Without Faith it is impoſsible to pleaſe God.</hi> Rom. 5. 1, <hi>Being therefore juſtified by Faith, let us have Peace toward God, by our Lord Jeſus Chriſt: By whom alſo we have acceſs, through Faith, to his Grace.</hi> This Ground then is certain, and cannot be denied by any Chriſtian.</p>
            <p>For my Second Ground I lay: That this <hi>Faith in Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> which by God's Ordination, is of neceſſity required to Salvation; is not a mere <hi>Natural Faith,</hi> or <hi>Humane Credu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity;</hi> which Men may have by their own natural Forces, without the help of God's ſpecial Grace; ſuch as is the Faith of <hi>Heathens,</hi> of <hi>Jews,</hi> and <hi>Turks;</hi> and ſuch indeed, as is the Faith of all <hi>Hereticks:</hi> But it is a Divine, and Supernatural thing, which Men acquire and attain to, by the ſpecial Aid of
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:95768:34"/> God, by the help of Divine Grace; and therefore this Faith is called, and truly is, <hi>The gift of God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This ground is certain, firſt out of the Word of God, which clearly teacheth, That <hi>ſaving Faith is the gift of God,</hi> Phil. 1. 29. <hi>To you it is given for Chriſt, not only to Believe in him, but alſo to Suffer for him.</hi> Eph. 2. 8. <hi>By Grace you are ſaved through Faith, and that not of your ſelves, for it is the gift of God: Not of Works, that no Man may glory.</hi> Joh. 6. 44. <hi>No Man can come unto me,</hi> (that is, believe in me; for our firſt ſtep toward Chriſt is Faith,) <hi>unleſs the Father that ſent me draw him.</hi> And Verſe 65. <hi>Therefore did I ſay to you, that no Man can come to me, unleſs it be given him of my Father.</hi> Joh. 15. 5. <hi>I am the Vine, you the Branches; he that abideth in me, and I in him, the ſame bringeth much fruit; for without me, you can do no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing.</hi> Namely, appertaining to Salvation; and therefore not believe, as is requiſite to Life Everlaſting, without the help of Chriſt, that is, of Divine Grace by Chriſt merited, and purchaſed for us. Theſe places are clear.</p>
            <p>Secondly, This ground is ſtrongly proved by Reaſon: For the end of Man being to enjoy <hi>Supernatural Glory,</hi> that is the clear Viſion of God, in his bleſſed Kingdom: The means to obtain this high and divine End muſt be ſuitable to it, that is, <hi>Divine,</hi> and <hi>Supernatural.</hi> For who will ſay, that Man of himſelf, and by his own forces, without the Aid and ſpecial Favour of God, is able to make himſelf fit, and proportionate, to be aſſociated to the <hi>Saints,</hi> to the <hi>Angels,</hi> to <hi>Chriſt,</hi> to <hi>God,</hi> in Eternal Glory? Who will ſay, that of himſelf, he is able to cleanſe his Soul from the ſtains and filth of Sin, and to put upon her a Wedding Garment, a Golden, and Reſplendent Veſture, ſuitable to the Banquet and Banqueters, of Heaven? The ſpecial Operation then of Divine Grace, muſt Purifie and Embelliſh the Soul of Man, and Attire her in Holy and Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Virtues, that ſo ſhe may be fit to be the Conſort of God, in the fruition of his Eternal Glory. And ſo <hi>Faith,</hi> which is one of theſe Virtues, and the very Ground and Foundation
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:95768:34"/> of the reſt, muſt be <hi>Divine</hi> and <hi>Supernatural,</hi> and ſpring in Man, from the help of God's Grace; and be Adorned and Dignified by it, that ſo there may be a fit proportion betwixt the <hi>Root</hi> and the <hi>Tree,</hi> the <hi>Seed</hi> and the <hi>Fruit,</hi> the <hi>Egg</hi> and the <hi>Bird,</hi> a <hi>Chriſtian Life,</hi> and the <hi>Glory of Heaven.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Whoſoever will deny this ground, muſt not only forſake the clear Doctrine of the Holy Scriptures, and go againſt the light of Reaſon, but he muſt alſo fall into the <hi>Pelagian He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſie,</hi> condemned by the <hi>Church of Chriſt,</hi> Twelve Hundred Years ago. Which held, That the Goſpel of Chriſt, being propoſed by his <hi>Preachers,</hi> Men of themſelves, without any further help of <hi>Divine Grace,</hi> are able to believe the ſame, and to do all therein required to Life Everlaſting. Which proud phanſy of <hi>Pelagius,</hi> St. <hi>Hierom,</hi> S. <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> and eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially the <hi>Biſhops of Rome,</hi> by the invincible force of God's Word, did cruſh, confound, and beat to the ground.</p>
            <p>My third Ground is, That as God cannot be the Author of a <hi>Lye,</hi> of <hi>falſe Doctrine,</hi> of a <hi>falſe Faith,</hi> of a <hi>falſe Religion:</hi> That is, of a <hi>Religion</hi> and <hi>Doctrine</hi> of <hi>Faith,</hi> that is mixed with Falſhood, and is partly true, and partly falſe: So he neither doth, neither can ſtir up, and draw Men by his ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial Grace, Aid, and Operation, to believe thoſe <hi>Religions,</hi> or <hi>Doctrines</hi> of <hi>Faith,</hi> which are ſo mixed with Falſhood. This ſeems to be evident, even by the light of Reaſon; for as it is the proper work of the Devil, to mix <hi>Religions,</hi> and to pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute them with Falſhood: So it is his continual, and ſtudious endeavour, to ſtir up, and induce Men, (by propoſing ſome pleaſing and delectable thing or other,) to believe and embrace the ſame, that ſo he may deprive them of <hi>Divine Faith,</hi> which is the <hi>Gift of God,</hi> and bring them aſſuredly to Everlaſting Damnation. Neither let any one be ſo ſimple, as to imagine, That the Devil is only the Author of thoſe <hi>Religions,</hi> which are wholly Falſe. For ſcarcely is there any <hi>Religion</hi> in the World, that doth teach no Truth at all. And therefore it is ſufficient, to prove a <hi>Religion</hi> to be the work of the Devil,
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:95768:35"/> if there be any Falſhood in it at all, as S. <hi>Paul</hi> doth ſeem to teach, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4. 1. where, foretelling the riſing of the <hi>Mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chean Hereſie,</hi> which long did Peſter the Church of God, he call's the Doctrine thereof, the <hi>Doctrine of Devils:</hi> Notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding that thoſe <hi>Hereticks,</hi> with ſome Falſhoods, did teach many Truths; even as all <hi>Hereticks</hi> do; who, nevertheleſs, are the Inſtruments of the Devil, to ſeduce and deſtroy Souls.</p>
            <p>Wherefore, whoſoever do culpably Believe, and Follow <hi>Religions,</hi> or <hi>Doctrines</hi> of <hi>Faith,</hi> partly True, partly Falſe, do never believe the ſame with <hi>Divine Faith,</hi> which is the <hi>Gift of God;</hi> though they eſteem the <hi>Religion</hi> which they follow, to be the beſt of all others; yea, to be the pure Light of the <hi>Goſpel of Chriſt:</hi> But their <hi>Faith</hi> is ever a meer <hi>Humane Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulity,</hi> ſuch as is the <hi>Faith</hi> of all Miſ-believers, which can never bring them to Eternal Happineſs, how laudably ſoever they live; becauſe without <hi>Divine Faith,</hi> that is, the <hi>Gift of God,</hi> no Man can be ſaved, according to the ſettled Ordination, and Providence of God; as I before have clearly ſhewed out of his Word.</p>
            <p>Out of this Doctrine, which is moſt True, doth appear, Firſt, The Reaſon of the Doctrine of Chriſt, deliver'd <hi>Matt.</hi> 7. where he declares, That falſe <hi>Prophets,</hi> that is, falſe Expoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of the Word of God, in Matters of <hi>Faith,</hi> do deſtroy Souls, like as Wolves do deſtroy Sheep; and that it is as impoſſible, that thei Followers ſhould acquire, by their Teaching, <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Faith,</hi> and <hi>True Sanctity,</hi> as it is impoſſible, that Thorns ſhould bring out Grapes, or Thiſtles, Figgs. The ſame Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine is taught by the Apoſtle; who affirms, That <hi>Hereticks</hi> are <hi>Subverted,</hi> Tit. 3. And <hi>Subvert the Faith of others,</hi> 2 Tim. 2. 18. That they <hi>make Shipwrack about Faith,</hi> 1 Tim. 1. 19. That they <hi>depart from the Faith,</hi> 1 Tim. 4. 1. That they are <hi>Reprobate about Faith,</hi> 2 Tim. 3. 8. and the like. Which miſchief they fall into themſelves, and bring upon their Fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers, though they Err but in one <hi>Article of Faith,</hi> as <hi>Hime<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naeus</hi>
               <pb n="47" facs="tcp:95768:35"/> and <hi>Philetus</hi> did, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. 18. And as <hi>Arius</hi> did at the firſt, denying the Equality of the Father and the Son.</p>
            <p>But Note here, That the Apoſtle in the places cited, doth not mean, that <hi>Heretical Teachers,</hi> do ſo Subvert and Ruine the Faith of their Followers, that they leave them no Faith at all; but that they Subvert their <hi>Divine Faith,</hi> which is the <hi>Gift of God,</hi> wholly overthrowing that, though they leave them ſtore of Humane Faith; to which ſeduced People firm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſticking, yea ſometimes even to Fetters and Death, do reap thereby nothing at all, but <hi>Temporal Commodities,</hi> and Vain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glory, purchaſed with the Eternal loſs of their Souls.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> Doth appear, out of the ſame Doctrine, the great Obligation that <hi>Chriſtian People</hi> have, to keep themſelves within the Boſom of the True and <hi>Catholick Church of Chriſt:</hi> Becauſe that this Church, being <hi>continually aſsiſted by Chriſt himſelf,</hi> Matth. 28. 20. And taught <hi>all Truth by the Holy Ghoſt,</hi> John 16. 13. doth propoſe unto her Followers, in her Doctrine of Faith, nothing but Truth; whereby their <hi>Faith</hi> doth eaſily come to be <hi>Divine,</hi> and the <hi>Gift of God,</hi> his Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Grace Co-operating with them. It doth alſo appear, how deeply they are obliged to take heed of, and to ſhun, and avoid Falſe Prophets; Falſe, and Heretical Expounders of God's Word; which run of their own accord, not being ſent, authorized, or allowed of, by the Ordinary Doctors, and Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtors, of the Ever Viſible and <hi>Catholick Church of Chriſt:</hi> And how wary they ought to be, not to have itching Ears, after new Maſters, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4. 3. Or greedily to hearken to their Novelties in Matters of Faith; which upon the reckoning, will be found to be no better than Fables, that is, than the Fictitious and Self-inventions of Mens Brains: Though theſe buſie Teachers palliate them, with ſpecious terms, and bear their Hearers in Hand, That theſe their new devices, are the <hi>Pure Light of the Goſpel.</hi> For by forſaking the <hi>Doctrine of the Church,</hi> the Spiritual Mother and Miſtreſs of all Nations; and as the Apoſtle terms her, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. 15. <hi>The Pillar and</hi>
               <pb n="48" facs="tcp:95768:36"/> 
               <hi>Ground of Truth,;</hi> and following ſuch <hi>New Teachers,</hi> they make Shipwrack of their <hi>Divine Faith,</hi> and run themſelves aſſuredly upon the Rock of Perdition.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> It appears how dangerouſly thoſe are deceived, who think they have Faith enough to Salvation, if they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve thoſe Points of the <hi>Chriſtian Religion,</hi> about which both <hi>Catholicks</hi> and <hi>Proteſtants</hi> agree; eſteeming themſelves not obliged to believe any of thoſe Articles, about which the Learned of theſe two <hi>Religions</hi> do differ and contend. As though <hi>Chriſtian People</hi> were not obliged, under pain of Dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, to <hi>beware of Falſe Prophets,</hi> Matth. 7. <hi>To ſhun Hereti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Teachers,</hi> Tit. 3. <hi>To obey their Lawful Prelates, and to be ſubject unto them,</hi> in Matters of Faith and Religion, <hi>Heb.</hi> 13. <hi>To hear thoſe Teachers,</hi> whom Chriſt doth ſend, <hi>Luk.</hi> 10. <hi>To hear and obey the Voice of his Church,</hi> if they will not be held to be in as ill Caſe, as <hi>Publicans,</hi> and <hi>Ethnicks</hi> are, Matth. 18.</p>
            <p>Or as though they were not bound to know the right means, by which they are to be Juſtified, cleanſed from Sin, and Saved; to Believe rightly, and to <hi>Receive worthily, the great Sacrament of the Body and Blood of Chriſt,</hi> 1 Cor. 11. <hi>Joh.</hi> 6. And as though they were not obliged, under the ſame Penalty, to believe and profeſs the True Goſpel, the <hi>True Faith</hi> and <hi>Religion of Chriſt;</hi> and to Serve, and Worſhip God rightly. Seeing thoſe which believe not his Goſpel, that is, the whole Summ of Divine Doctrine, taught by his Apoſtles, Apoſtles, and by their Succeſſors, the Ordinary Doctors, and Paſtors of his Church, <hi>are to be Damned, Mark</hi> 16. As thoſe alſo are, <hi>Which deny Chriſt before Men,</hi> Matth. 10. 33. Which Crime all commit, who deny themſelves to be of the <hi>True Religion,</hi> as is manifeſt by the Example of St. <hi>Peter,</hi> who de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nying only, that he was a Follower of Chriſt, and of his Company, was reputed to deny Chriſt; even as thoſe will be, who culpably profeſs a <hi>Falſe Religion.</hi> For ſuch by their very Fact, deny the True, and themſelves to be of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion thereof, and of the Company, and Society of the True
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:95768:36"/> Followers, Diſciples and Servants of Chriſt, whereby, at his Judgement-ſeat, they will be reputed to have forſaken and denied him.</p>
            <p>But to open this Point a little more (becauſe many, even of the better ſort, are brought thereby into no ſmall danger of Perdition) this their Conceit is not grounded upon any clear Text of <hi>Gods Word,</hi> or upon the Authority of any <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>n<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erring Church,</hi> but meerly upon a Miſtake of their own; by which, out of one or two Truths, they infer a pernicious Falſhood; upon which, while they truſt, they truſt to a bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken Staff, which at their laſt Leap, will let them fall into the deep Ditch of Perdition, if before their Death they caſt it not away.</p>
            <p>The firſt Truth is, that the Illiterate, Simple, Unlearned of the <hi>True and Catholick Church of Chriſt,</hi> are not bound to know, and expreſly believe (that is, with Faith explicit, as Divines ſpeak) all the <hi>Articles of Faith,</hi> which the Learned <hi>Doctors</hi> and <hi>Paſtors</hi> of this <hi>Church,</hi> do know, and believe. But ſuch do ſatisfie the Precept of Faith, if they believe with Faith explicit, the prime and more celebrated Articles and Miſteries of the <hi>Christian Religion</hi> contained in the <hi>Creed,</hi> or ſolemnized by the <hi>Church,</hi> which appertain to the right knowledge of the <hi>Trinity, Incarnation, Paſſion,</hi> and <hi>Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection of Christ,</hi> and which concern the <hi>Redemption, Juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, Sanctification</hi> and <hi>Glorification of Man,</hi> ſo that they believe the reſt with Faith implicit; that is, ſo that they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve as the Church believes, being ever ready, in Heart and Affection, to ſubmit their Judgements, in matters of <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Religion,</hi> to the Judgement of the <hi>Church,</hi> and to believe as She ſhall teach.</p>
            <p>But yet although ſuch are not bound to believe expreſly, and in particular, all the <hi>Articles of Faith</hi> which the Learned <hi>Paſtors of the Church</hi> believe, yet they are bound, under the Penalty of <hi>Eternal Damnation,</hi> not to deny wittingly, any one of them, nor to doubt ſtubbornly of the truth of them,
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:95768:37"/> nor to believe wittingly the contrary; for he that ſo doth, falleth thereby into the damning Crime of <hi>Hereſie.</hi> Which ever includes <hi>an Election,</hi> or <hi>Culling out</hi> (of certain Articles) out of the <hi>Doctrine of the Church,</hi> which are imbraced for true, and a <hi>Rejection</hi> of the reſt, as Doubtful, Falſe, or Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ronious.</p>
            <p>Which preſumptuous diſcarding of Divine Verities, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed by Chriſt to his <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> for the direction of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind to Eternal Happineſs, and by them laid up in the Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſury of the <hi>Church,</hi> as a <hi>Sacred Depoſitum,</hi> 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6. 20. un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the ſure Cuſtody of the Holy Ghoſt, is no leſs than High-Treaſon againſt Chriſt our Saviour, in regard that it raiſes a moſt <hi>pernicious Rebellion</hi> in his Spiritual Kingdom, bringing part thereof again under the Tyranny of the Devil. It fruſtrates the full Operation of his Paſſion, extinguiſhes the true and right Worſhip of God, deſpoils <hi>Chriſtian People</hi> of <hi>Divine Faith,</hi> and thereby of the true means of Salvation. It deprives the Saints of due Honour, defrauds the Faithful departed of neceſſary Relief. It robbs Heaven of Souls, and inriches Hell with innumerable unwary, and moſt unhappy People. For which reſpects, it is rightly ſtiled one of the greateſt Sins, and of the loudeſt crying Crimes that is.</p>
            <p>Although I ſay, the Unlearned of the Church are not bound to believe explicitly, all Her Sacred Verities, yet they are bound not to deny any one of them wittingly; even as they are not bound to know all that is in the <hi>Sacred Scripture,</hi> yet they are bound not to deny any thing therein contain'd, though it be never ſo ſmall a thing, becauſe all is warranted by the Authority of God, which is of equal Force and Worth, of equal Truth, both in great and in ſmall things, which therefore are of equal Certainty, it being as far from God, to lie and deceive in ſmall things as in great. And therefore prudent Men, in Matters of <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> ſeek no farther, than whether this, or that be warranted by Gods Authority, or no, which they learn by the Teaching
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:95768:37"/> of the <hi>Church,</hi> guided by the <hi>Holy Ghost,</hi> for there is no other ſure and infallible Means on Earth, to direct us in the obſcure <hi>Misteries</hi> of <hi>Faith,</hi> about which anew, God now re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veals nothing, but leaves us to the Teaching of his Church, guided, as I ſaid, by the Holy Ghoſt; which makes all <hi>Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creet Chriſtians</hi> to ſubmit ſo humbly their Judgements to the Church, and to relie ſo ſecurely upon her Authority; God himſelf aſſuring them, that She is the <hi>Pillar and Ground of Truth,</hi> 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. 15.</p>
            <p>The Second Truth is, That the Subjects of the Church of Chriſt, are not bound either to know or believe certain diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putable Points of Divinity, not defin'd by the Church, which are controverted among the Learned.</p>
            <p>The pernicious Falſhood inferred out of theſe Truths, is, That Chriſtian People, who are not Learned, are not bound, under hazard of their Souls, to believe thoſe <hi>Articles of Faith,</hi> taught by the the True and Catholick <hi>Church of Christ,</hi> which falſe <hi>Prophets,</hi> which <hi>Heretical</hi> Men, reputed Learned, do queſtion, deny, and diſpute againſt. As though the Bad, Proud, Rebellious and Ungodly, proceeding of theſe Men, were a ſufficient Warrant unto others, to doubt of the Truth of Gods revealed Verities; to mangle and believe by halves his <hi>Sacred Religion,</hi> to diſobey their <hi>Lawful Prelates,</hi> to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prive their Souls of the fruitful uſe of Chriſts Divine Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, to contemn the Doctrine, and to forſake the <hi>Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of the Church.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Which is manifeſtly abſurd and untrue, being contrary both to Reaſon and Scripture, as I have ſhewed. Which teach that <hi>Christian People,</hi> in the profound Myſteries of the <hi>Christian Religion,</hi> are bound to be guided by thoſe <hi>Doctors</hi> and <hi>Paſtors, Act.</hi> 20. which God hath placed in his Church, and authoriſed to Teach, Direct, and Guide them. And that they are likewiſe moſt deeply obliged, to beware of, and to ſhun falſe Prophets, and <hi>Heretical Teachers,</hi> and not to heap to themſelves new Maſters, with itching Ears, leaving the
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:95768:38"/> Truth of the <hi>Pillar of Truth,</hi> the <hi>Church</hi> of the <hi>Living God,</hi> and turning to <hi>Fables,</hi> that is, either to their own Self-con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceits, or to the Self-conceits of others, which in the Myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of the <hi>Chriſtian Religion,</hi> when they ſwerve from the <hi>Doctrine of the Church,</hi> are no truer than <hi>Fables,</hi> though they be gilded over with the fair Title of the true Light of the Goſpel; and therefore the Faith of thoſe, who are guided by ſuch Conceiters, is never <hi>Divine,</hi> never the <hi>Gift of God,</hi> never available to Salvation.</p>
            <p>For the clear underſtanding of which Aſſertion; Note <hi>First,</hi> That moſt true it is, that God hath revealed many <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found Miſteries.</hi> and <hi>Divine Verities</hi> for Men to believe, to be thereby directed fittingly what to hold, and to practiſe, for the obtaining of ever-during Happineſs.</p>
            <p>Note <hi>Secondly,</hi> That it is alſo moſt true, that Man of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, without the Aid of Coeleſtial Grace, is not able to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve theſe Verities fittingly and ſuitably to his <hi>Supernatural</hi> End.</p>
            <p>Note <hi>Thirdly,</hi> That God cannot ſtir up, and draw men, by this his <hi>Heavenly Grace,</hi> to believe theſe Verities, unleſs they be propoſed to be believ'd without all mixture of Falſhood; for if any Falſhood be packt in among them, and propoſed with them for a <hi>Divine Truth,</hi> revealed by God, he cannot draw men, by his Grace, to believe them thus mingled and propoſed with <hi>Falſhood,</hi> as is manifeſt, becauſe he cannot in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce men to believe any Falſhood at all. And therefore, whoſoever doth thruſt in, among ſome <hi>Divine Verities,</hi> any falſe Doctrine, contrary to that which God hath revealed, propoſing the ſame to be believed as a Divine Truth, and therein ſtubbornly contradicting the <hi>Teaching of the Church,</hi> he debars God from co-opperating with his Grace, and from drawing People to believe, with <hi>Divine Faith,</hi> the Doctrine ſo mixt and propoſed.</p>
            <p>Note <hi>Fourthly,</hi> That Gods revealed Verities will fall out to be of no utility at all to Mankind, but rather a Trap to ruine
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:95768:38"/> them, unleſs there be ſome ſure, un-erring and infallible Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſer of them, who doth propoſe them to Gods People, without any mixture of Falſhood at all, in ſuch ſort, that he doth not propoſe any thing, as an Article revealed by God, which is not ſo, or which is falſe, and contrary to that which God hath indeed reveal'd. And therefore that God may draw men, by the ſpecial aid of his Grace, to believe with <hi>Divine Faith,</hi> his revealed Miſteries and Verities; he muſt cauſe them to be propoſed to men ſincerely, and without all mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of Falſhood; He I ſay, muſt cauſe them to be ſo pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed, becauſe no man of himſelf, without the continual gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance and aſſiſtance of the Holy Ghoſt, is able always ſo to propoſe them.</p>
            <p>All then, that will have <hi>Divine Faith,</hi> muſt be guided by Gods Propoſer of <hi>Divine Doctrine,</hi> and believe as he doth teach. For if they follow any contrary Propoſer, who does mingle Truth with Falſhood, contrary to the Doctrine of the right Propoſer, their <hi>Faith</hi> cannot be <hi>Divine,</hi> nor avail them to Salvation. If any one ask who is Gods un-erring Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſer of <hi>Divine Verities,</hi> I anſwer now, as I anſwer'd before, no other but the Ordinary Doctors and Paſtors of the ever viſible and <hi>Catholick Church of Christ;</hi> which Doctors and Paſtors, among other things, propoſe as a Divine and cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Truth, that out of the Communion of the <hi>True</hi> and <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick Church,</hi> no Salvation can be had: out of whoſe Communion, thoſe moſt certainly do live, who are ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted from the Chair of St. <hi>Peter,</hi> and profeſs <hi>Riligions</hi> by it condemned. And therefore thoſe which eſteem themſelves ſecure, by believing only thoſe general Points of the <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Religion,</hi> which are not controverted betwixt the Learned of the <hi>Proteſtant,</hi> and of the <hi>Roman Church,</hi> are greatly deceived, they being not only deſtitute of <hi>Divine Faith,</hi> but alſo very far off from performing the Duty of good Chriſtians, as may ſufficiently appear by what is ſaid. And therefore this their Conceit, ſerves to little elſe, but
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:95768:39"/> to bring them to Hell with a quiet and unfrighted Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fourthly,</hi> Out of the Grounds laid, a ſufficient Reaſon doth appear of the <hi>Doctrine</hi> of the <hi>Ancient Fathers,</hi> who con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly taught, that out of the <hi>Catholick Church</hi> there is no Salvation; which <hi>Catholick Church,</hi> they eſteemed to be no other, than that which is joyned in Communion with the <hi>Chair of</hi> St. <hi>Peter.</hi> Hear a word or two out of thoſe ancient Worthies; St. <hi>Athanaſius</hi> in his <hi>Creed,</hi> approved of, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived by the whole Church, ſpeaketh thus, <hi>Whoſoever will be ſaved, before all things it is needful, that he hold the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Faith; the which, unleſs one keep entire and inviolate, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out all doubt, he ſhall periſh eternally.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>St. <hi>Cyprian, De Simpl. Prelat.</hi> And St. <hi>Auguſtin, De Simbol. l.</hi> 4. <hi>c.</hi> 10. ſaith, <hi>If any one be found without the Church, he ſhall be an Alien from the Children of God, neither ſhall he have God for his Father, who would not have the Church for his Mother.</hi> The ſame St. <hi>Auguſtin,</hi> ſpeaking of <hi>Emeritus</hi> a <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natiſt,</hi> and a Biſhop ſaith, <hi>Serm. de geſtis cum Emerito. He cannot have Salvation, but in the Catholick Church, out of the Church he may have all but Salvation. He may have Honour, he may have the Sacrament, he may ſing Alleluja, he may anſwer Amen, he may hold the Goſpel, he may both have and preach Faith, in the Name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghoſt; but Salvation he can no where have, ſaving in the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Church.</hi> Where note, that Biſhop <hi>Emeritus</hi> being a <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natiſt,</hi> was not ſo much ſeparated from the <hi>Roman Church,</hi> as <hi>Proteſtants</hi> are. And yet this Learned Father, and great Light of Gods Church, eſteemed him to be out of the <hi>Catholick Church,</hi> and out of the State of Salvation. In vain then do <hi>Protestants</hi> confide, that they are within the <hi>Catholick Church,</hi> they being farther ſeparated from the ſame than this Biſhop was.</p>
            <p>St. <hi>Fulgentius, De Fid. ad Pet. c.</hi> 39. ſaith, <hi>Most firmly hold, and in no ſort doubt, that each Heretick, or Schiſmatick Bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed in the Name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy</hi>
               <pb n="55" facs="tcp:95768:39"/> 
               <hi>Ghost, if he be not restored to the Catholick Church, how great Alms ſoever he give, yea, though he ſhould ſhed his Blood for the Name of Christ, yet he cannot be ſaved.</hi> Thus theſe Holy and Learned Fathers, with whom, in this Point agree the reſt.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fifthly,</hi> It appears by the Grounds aforeſaid, that there can be but only one <hi>ſaving Faith</hi> and <hi>Religion</hi> in the World, becauſe there can be but only one <hi>Doctrine of Faith</hi> that is wholly true, and free from all mixture of Falſhood; for all other <hi>Doctrines of Faith,</hi> muſt of neceſſity be mixed and ſtain'd with ſome Falſhood, more or leſs, according as they do, more or leſs differ from, and contradict, that one Divine <hi>Doctrine of Faith,</hi> which is wholly true, as is manifeſt. And therefore God cannot draw men to believe any of them, with <hi>Divine Faith,</hi> required of neceſſity to Salvation. And ſo no <hi>Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,</hi> whoſe <hi>Doctrine of Faith</hi> is mixed with Falſhood, is truly and really a <hi>ſaving Religion;</hi> how much ſoever it be adorned by the <hi>ſeducing Teachers,</hi> or the ſeduced Fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers thereof, with the gay Title of the pure Light of the Goſpel.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sixthly,</hi> It appears how juſt cauſe all <hi>Proteſtants</hi> have to return with ſpeed to the <hi>Roman Church,</hi> in which they may aſſuredly be ſaved, even by the Judgement of the moſt Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed among them, as hereafter ſhall appear; becauſe it is more than probable, that the <hi>Proteſtant Profeſſion</hi> is not a <hi>ſaving Religion,</hi> in regard, that the <hi>Doctrine of Faith,</hi> which it im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braceth, is not, nor cannot be wholly true, but really and certainly is mixed with much Falſhood, 1. Becauſe in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers weighty <hi>Points of Faith,</hi> it directly contradicts the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs Word of God, as I before have ſhewed.</p>
            <p>2. Becauſe this <hi>Doctrine of Faith,</hi> is not directed by any ſure Rule of <hi>Faith,</hi> by any <hi>Infallible Interpreter</hi> of the Scriptures, by any Un-erring Judge of <hi>Controverſies,</hi> nor pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed by any ſure and Infallible Propoſer. 3. Becauſe <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants</hi> are divided into ſeveral <hi>Branches</hi> or <hi>Sects,</hi> which
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:95768:40"/> greatly differ, and are contrary one to another, in divers weighty Points of Faith, as I before have noted. And 4. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe <hi>Proteſtants</hi> hold, that all Churches are ſubject to erring, yea, and have erred in their <hi>Doctrine of Faith.</hi> What aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance then have they, that Theirs doth not err? none at all.</p>
            <p>But to come now to the principal Point intended in this <hi>Question;</hi> I affirm, that out of the Grounds laid, which Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianly cannot be deny'd, it clearly follows, that according to the main Tenet, and Ground of the <hi>Proteſtant Religion,</hi> Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus, the Son of the Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> was not the true <hi>Meſſias</hi> promiſed in the <hi>Old Teſtament,</hi> nor the true Saviour of the World. This monſtrous Falſhood, and deteſtable Blaſphemy, I ſay, doth clearly and inevitably follow, out of the chief and Fundamental Ground of the <hi>Proteſtant Religion.</hi> For if the <hi>Church,</hi> which Jeſus founded, came to erre in her <hi>Doctrine of Faith,</hi> in the Ages after the <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> and to be corrupted with many pernicious Falſhoods and Superſtitions, as <hi>Protestant Teachers</hi> affirm, the Promiſes of God, concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the <hi>Meſſias,</hi> made ſo ſeriouſly to the Patriarchs of the <hi>Old Teſtament,</hi> cannot poſſibly be verified of Jeſus, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently he was not the true <hi>Meſſias,</hi> the true Chriſt and Saviour of the World; for of the true <hi>Meſſias</hi> theſe Promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes muſt be verified moſt certainly, in regard that God can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be falſe of his Word.</p>
            <p>Thus then he promiſed to <hi>Abraham,</hi> Gen. 12. 3. <hi>In thee ſhall all the Kindreds of the Earth be bleſſed.</hi> Gen. 18, 18. <hi>In him</hi> (Abraham) <hi>are to be bleſſed all the Nations of the Earth.</hi> To <hi>Iſaac,</hi> Gen. 26. 4. <hi>In thy Seed ſhall be bleſſed all the Nations of the Earth.</hi> To <hi>Jacob,</hi> Gen. 28. 14. <hi>In thee and in thy Seed, all the Tribes of the Earth ſhall be bleſſed.</hi> That is, in Chriſt, in the true <hi>Meſſias,</hi> as the Apoſtle does interpret; <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. 6. Of whom alſo the <hi>Royal Prophet</hi> ſang. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 17. 7. <hi>All the Tribes of the Earth ſhall be bleſſed in him, all Nations ſhall magnifie him.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="57" facs="tcp:95768:40"/>
            <p> Now then, out of theſe places of Holy Writ, it ſeems clear: <hi>Firſt,</hi> That according to Gods often re-iterated Promiſe, all the Nations of the Earth, are truly to be Bleſſed in the <hi>Meſſias,</hi> the Hopeful Seed of the <hi>Patriarchs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> It ſeems clear, that this ſo Solemnly Promis'd Bleſſing, was not chiefly to conſiſt in Earthly, Temporal, Tranſitory Riches and Happineſs, but in Heavenly, Spiritual, Eternal.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> It ſeems clear, that the Nations of the Earth, are to obtain this Bleſſing, by Receiving, Believing, Practiſing that <hi>Religion,</hi> and Worſhip of God, which the <hi>Meſſias</hi> was to inſtitute, and to introduce amongſt them, by the Teaching of his Doctors and Paſtors. See <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4. 12.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fourthly,</hi> It ſeems clear, that the <hi>Religion</hi> of the <hi>True Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſias,</hi> is not to be introduc'd amongſt the Nations of the Earth, in one Year, or in one Age: But by degrees, and by the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours and Charitable Endeavours of many Ages: Becauſe the ſame is not to be brought in by Force, but by Fair Means: Not by the Soldiers Sword, but by the Teachers Word: Not by Violent Compulſion, but by Gentle Perſwaſion; ſuch as the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> and <hi>Apoſtolical Teachers</hi> have ever us'd. <hi>Going,</hi> (ſaith our Sweet Saviour) <hi>Teach all Nations,</hi> Matth. 28. And therefore this muſt needs be a work of long continuance; the Nations of the Earth being ſo many as they are, ſo diſpers'd over the whole World, and diſ-joyn'd one from another, by Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains and Seas; ſo Barbarous, ſo Drench'd in Sin, inur'd to Carnal and Brutiſh Cuſtoms: And the Religion of the <hi>Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſias,</hi> being ſo Holy and Profound, as <hi>Gods Religion</hi> muſt be. Yea, this Divine Work, of notifying the <hi>Meſſias,</hi> to all the Nations of the Earth, and of Converting them, or at leaſt part of each of them to him, is to endure and laſt, even till the end of the World; as is manifeſt out of our Saviours Words, before alleadg'd out of the 24 of <hi>Matth.</hi> See the place, and weigh it well.</p>
            <pb n="58" facs="tcp:95768:41"/>
            <p> 
               <hi>Fifthly,</hi> It is certain, out of the grounds before laid, that the Nations of the Earth, cannot believe the <hi>Religion</hi> of the <hi>Meſſias</hi> availably to Salvation, and gain thereby the Promis'd Bleſſing, without the help of <hi>Divine Grace:</hi> That is, unleſs by the ſpecial working and Aid of God, they be effectually mov'd, ſtir'd up, and drawn, to forſake their <hi>Old</hi> and <hi>Blind Traditions,</hi> their Falſe and Idolatrous Worſhips, their Beaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and Abominable Manners, to imbrace and practice Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giouſly the Holy Difficil and deep Religion of the <hi>Meſſias,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving the ſame, with ſuch, and ſo Divine a Faith, as really is the <hi>Gift of God;</hi> without which no man can be Sav'd.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sixthly,</hi> It is alſo certain, out of the ſame grounds, that God by his Grace, and ſpecial Aid, cannot ſtir up, and effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally draw the Nations of the Earth, to Receive, Believe and and Practice the <hi>Religion</hi> of the <hi>Meſſias,</hi> unleſs it be wholly true: Unleſs I ſay it be wholly True, wholly Pure from Errors and Superſtitions. For if with ſuch ſtuff, it be mix'd, corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, defil'd, and made diſpleaſing to God, and hurtful to the Soul of Man, it is impoſſible, that God by his Aid and Grace, ſhould induce and draw Men to Believe it: As the very Light of Reaſon doth Teach. Note, This well.</p>
            <p>And therefore, as the Work of the Converſion of Nations, to the <hi>Meſſias,</hi> that they may be made Bleſſed in him, muſt continue in all Ages, even till the end of the World: So moſt certainly, the True <hi>Meſſias</hi> muſt ever preſerve in the World, even till the end thereof, a <hi>Holy</hi> and <hi>Divine Religion,</hi> a Doctrine of Faith intirely and wholly True, intirely and wholly Pure, from Errours and Superſtitions, that ſo the Bleſſed Majeſty of Heaven, by his Divine and Powerful Grace, may draw the Nations of the Earth, to Believe this his <hi>Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,</hi> and to practice it Religiouſly, that thereby they may become Bleſſed in Him. All this is clear and manifeſt out of the Word of God, the Light of Reaſon, and the grounds laid.</p>
            <pb n="59" facs="tcp:95768:41"/>
            <p> But Jeſus, for above theſe thouſand, twelve hundred, or fourteen hundred years, hath not had any <hi>Religion</hi> ſpread over the World, among the Nations of the Earth, and Preach'd unto them, to make them Bleſſed in Him, which hath been wholly True, and Pure from Errors and Superſtitions; (if <hi>Proteſtant Teachers</hi> ſay true; and do not moſt dangerouſly miſtake, to the Perdition of themſelves and their Followers) <hi>Ergo,</hi> Jeſus is not the true <hi>Meſsias,</hi> the True Chriſt and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour of the World, according to the General Tenet of all <hi>Proteſtant Teachers,</hi> and the main ground of the <hi>Proteſtant Religion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For the True <hi>Meſsias,</hi> muſt of neceſſity, have ſuch a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion in all Ages, that thereby the Nations of the Earth may be Bleſſed in him: As I have clearly deduc'd and ſhew'd. But Jeſus (according to the Doctrine of <hi>Proteſtants)</hi> hath not had ſuch a Religion ſcarcely ſince the Apoſtles times: And therefore the Nations of the Earth, have not been Bleſſed in Him: And conſequently, if their Divinity be good, he is not the True <hi>Meſsias.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Nations of the Earth, I ſay, for above theſe twelve hundred years, have not been Bleſſed in Jeſus, by believing in him, for want of a <hi>True Religion,</hi> though very many of them, within this ſpace of time, have been Converted to him, by the <hi>Roman Church,</hi> by the Labours and Induſtry of <hi>Papiſts,</hi> both in <hi>Europe, Aſia, Africa,</hi> and the New-found World: Neither are they ever likely to be Bleſſed in Him: For if al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready he hath not taken order, to preſerve a True, Divine, and <hi>Pure Religion</hi> among them, to bring unto them the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mis'd Bleſſing, that is, to Sanctify, and Save them: He is never likely to do it. For he is not likely to be wiſer, or better, or more Powerful hereafter, than he hath been heretofore: Neither is he likely to come into the World again, to found a new <hi>Church</hi> and <hi>Religion,</hi> and to eſtabliſh it better, then He did his firſt, for the Salvation of Mankind.</p>
            <pb n="60" facs="tcp:95768:42"/>
            <p> Out of all which it follows clearly and manifeſtly, that, according to the Doctrine, and fundamental ground of the <hi>Proteſtant Religion</hi> (which is, that the Church of Jeſus, for many hundred years, hath ſhamefully and perniciouſly err'd in her Doctrine of Faith, and in the True Worſhip of God,) it follows, I ſay, out of this Aſſertion, clearly and manifeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that Jeſus was not, nor is not, the <hi>True Meſsias,</hi> the <hi>True Chriſt</hi> and <hi>Saviour of the World.</hi> Behold, here the true depth of the <hi>Proteſtant Religion,</hi> and whether it directly leads, if it's ſearch'd to the bottom: And doubt not, but that the Bird is naught, that lays ſo bad an Egg.</p>
            <p>What will <hi>Proteſtants</hi> anſwer here, to ſtruggle out of theſe narrow ſtraits? Will they ſay, that although Jeſus had not, for ſo many hundred years, any Viſible True Religion; yet he had an Inviſible <hi>True Religion,</hi> by which the Nations of the Earth were made Bleſſed? But then I demand <hi>1ſt.</hi> With what Spectacles do theſe men, who thus Anſwer, ſee this <hi>Inviſible Religion?</hi> Or how do they know there was any ſuch in the World? What Text of the <hi>Bible,</hi> what Hiſtory makes men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion thereof? <hi>2ly.</hi> Who were the Preachers of this Inviſible Religion? Who the Followers? What Nations receiv'd it? What <hi>Sacraments</hi> had it? What <hi>Divine Service,</hi> or <hi>Worſhip of God?</hi> In what <hi>Churches</hi> was it practic'd, or Caves, or De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarts? How did the Followers thereof know one another? What Candles did they uſe at their Meetings, all being In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſible amongſt them? <hi>3ly.</hi> What Fooliſh <hi>Heretick,</hi> may not, by thus Anſwering, maintain, that his Deviſes were ever ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant, though Inviſibly, and that the Nations of the Earth by them have been Bleſſed, yet Inviſibly?</p>
            <p>This Anſwer then being too too Abſurd and Ridiculous: Will other <hi>Proteſtants</hi> hope to evade, by ſaying, That although the Faith of the <hi>Roman Church,</hi> grew by degrees to be full of Errors and Superſtitions; yet the Nations of the Earth, were Sav'd thereby, and thereby were made truly Bleſſed in Jeſus? But then I demand firſt, whether the Faith of the <hi>Roman</hi>
               <pb n="61" facs="tcp:95768:42"/> 
               <hi>Church,</hi> be truly Holy, truly pleaſing to God, and profitable to Man, or no? If it be not, how could God draw Men by his Heavenly Grace, to believe it? But if it be, why did <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants</hi> at the firſt revolt from it? Or how durſt they lately Perſecute it? May they ſecurely Perſecute and ſeek to ruine that <hi>Religion,</hi> by which for ſo many hundred years, the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the Earth, have been made Bleſſed in Jeſus? I believe not.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> I demand by what Text of Scripture, or light of Reaſon, will <hi>Proteſtants</hi> maintain, that God by his Grace and ſpecial operation, can draw men to believe a falſe and <hi>Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitious Religion?</hi> A <hi>Religion,</hi> that had ſo great need of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming, that the World was to be turn'd up-ſide down, and Infinite Tumults, and Bloody Broils to be ſet a foot, rather than not to undertake it? If God can draw men by his Grace, can move and ſtir them up, to imbrace and believe Errors and <hi>Superſtitions,</hi> or <hi>Religions,</hi> that are Erronious and Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitious; how is he not, in this reſpect, as bad as the Devil? Or upon what firm ground can we maintain, that the Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion of <hi>Moſes,</hi> the <hi>Religion</hi> of <hi>Jeſus,</hi> was Pure and Holy? By ſaying and proving that God was the Author of theſe <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligions?</hi> That proves nothing, if God by his Grace, can draw men to believe <hi>Errors</hi> and <hi>Superſtitions.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> I demand If Jeſus was the true <hi>Meſsias,</hi> and that God did intend, to draw the Nations of the Earth, to believe in him, and to make them Bleſſed by him; was he not able to provide himſelf of a True, Holy and <hi>Divine Religion;</hi> to which with his Honour he might draw them: But muſt he needs make uſe of a Falſe, Blind, Superſtitious one, to the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tream Diſgrace of himſelf? Theſe Anſwers then being Abſurd, and far from ſatisfying Prudent men: To maintain, that Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus is the True <hi>Meſsias,</hi> and that the Promiſes of God, made to the <hi>Patriarchs,</hi> have been really fulfill'd in him: Will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderate <hi>Proteſtants</hi> grant and acknowledge, that he hath ever had in all Ages, a <hi>Divine Religion,</hi> wholly True, and truly
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:95768:43"/> Saving, ſpread over the World, to bring to the Nations there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, the promis'd Bleſſing?

            <head>Queſtion XI. <hi>Did the</hi> Church of Chriſt <hi>err heretofore, becauſe Chriſt could not preſerve her from erring, or becauſe he would not.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>MY Eleventh Demand of <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> is, if the Church of Chriſt, hath err'd, as they ſay, in her Doctrine of Faith, from whence proceeded, this her erring? Did this happen, becauſe Chriſt could not keep her from erring; or becauſe he would not? If he could not, how is he God? How is he Omnipotent? How is it True, that he had <hi>All Power given him both in Heaven and Earth,</hi> Mat. 28. 18. If Chriſt could enable his Apoſtles, to Preach his Religion, over the World, without danger of erring, and of deluding the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the Earth; why could he not alſo Enable their Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſors, the Ordinary Doctors and Paſtors of his Church, to Teach and continue the ſame Religion, in all ſucceeding Ages, without danger of erring, and of miſleading his People? If God could direct men to write his Holy Scriptures, without danger of erring; why can he not direct men, to explicate the ſame <hi>Holy Scriptures</hi> in all Ages, without danger of erring, in matters of Faith?</p>
            <p>Well then, <hi>Proteſtants</hi> muſt ſay, that Chriſt could have preſerv'd his Church, in all Ages, from danger of erring, in her Doctrine of Faith; but would not. But why would he not? Did the Increaſe of his own Credit and Glory, move him to this neglect, or the good of Mankind? Not the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe of his own Credit. For what Credit, Honour, Glory could acrew and ariſe to him, by the erring of his Church? Doth this commend his Workmanſhip, in Founding her? His Wiſdom, Goodneſs, Power in Governing her? I think
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:95768:44"/> not. Nay, could it become the Wiſdom of a Diſcreet man, to take ſo great Pains, and to ſuffer ſo Painful and Ignomini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous a Death, as Chriſt did, for the Founding of an Erring Church, which ſhould Delude and Miſlead the World? Would any <hi>Honeſt Proteſtant,</hi> if he had the like Power, that Chriſt had, have Founded ſo miſerable a Church, as they eſteem Chriſt to have Founded? I believe not.</p>
            <p>Was it then, the good of Mankind, that invited Chriſt, to Conſtitute an erring Church? Truly no. For no good can come to men, by ſuch a Church; but rather much harm; yea, infinite miſchief. As endleſs Diſcord, Broils, Contentions; Bloody Encounters, uncertainty in matters of Faith; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt of all Religion; and the ruine and deſtruction of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite Souls. For the Devil would never go about to ſeduce the Church, and to Pollute her Doctrine, with Errours and Superſtitions, but to do Miſchief, and to bring Souls to Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition.</p>
            <p>Wherefore ſeeing that it could not redound, either to the Glory of God, or the good of Men, that Chriſt ſhould Found an Erring Church; it is a very groſs Errour, to hold that he did. And thoſe, who ſo think; do greatly miſtake, and exceedingly wrong the Wiſdom, and Goodneſs of our Saviour; as will more clearly appear by the next Queſtion.</p>

            <head>Queſtion XII. <hi>If the</hi> Church of Chriſt <hi>did Err, for ſo many Ages; How can it be Defended, that God is Truly good, and doth Truly deſire the Salvation of Mankind?</hi>
            </head>
            <p>TWelfthly, If it be true, that the Church of Chriſt, for ſo many Ages, hath Err'd in her Doctrine of Faith: Imbracing, as it were, with both her Arms, and inſtilling into her Followers, many Pernicious Errors, many groſs Superſtitions: Notwithſtanding, that Chriſt her Spouſe and Saviour Promis'd, <hi>Math.</hi> 16. <hi>That the Gates of Hell ſhould never prevail againſt her.</hi> That the Holy Ghoſt ſhould <hi>Abide with her Paſtors for ever, St.</hi> John <hi>cap.</hi> 14. and ſhould <hi>Teach them all Truth,</hi> Joh. 16. That he himſelf would be with them <hi>All days, even till the End of the World,</hi> Mat. 28. And notwithſtanding, that God Promis'd, that <hi>His Spirit and Word ſhould never depart from this Church,</hi> Iſaias 59. That ſhe ſhould <hi>Stand for ever,</hi> Daniel 2. And ſhould <hi>Never be Corrupted,</hi> Daniel 7. Being indeed the <hi>Pillar and ground of Truth,</hi> As the Apoſtle affirms, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. If I ſay the Doctrine of <hi>Proteſtant Teachers,</hi> about the Erring of the Church of Chriſt, being ſo contrary to the Word of God as it is, be true.</p>
            <p>I demand of Prudent and Underſtanding <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> how it can be defended, that God is truly Good, hath a Fatherly care of Men, doth truly Love them, and tender their Spiritual good, and hath a true deſire of their Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Salvation: Seeing, that whereas he doth freely permit the Devil, to fill the World, with Falſe and Wicked Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gions, with Abominable and Deteſtable Worſhips, to bring
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:95768:45"/> Men aſſuredly to everlaſting Damnation: He himſelf (though he could moſt eaſily do it) doth not continue, maintain, and uphold in the World, in all Ages, ſo much as one True Religion, ſo much as one Holy and Divine Worſhip, to bring them to Salvation? No, not after that his Bleſſed Son made Man, by Infinite Humility, by Innu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merable Labours undergone for his ſake, by ſhedding his moſt Precious Blood, had endeavour'd to appeaſe his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignation, to mitigate his Wrath, and to Molify his Heart, and to gain and purchaſe Love and Mercy for them.</p>
            <p>What Chriſtian Breaſt, can believe ſo monſtrous a thing as this? Or who can Harbour ſo baſe a Thought of the the Wiſdom, Goodneſs, Sweetneſs and Mercy of God? Or how come Diſcreet and Underſtanding <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> to ſwallow ſo gtoſs an Abſurdity as this? If the Tenet of <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant Teachers,</hi> touching the Erring of the Church, be true; how is that true which Chriſt ſays, <hi>John</hi> 3. 16. <hi>That God ſo loved the World, that he gave his only begotten Son, that every one that believeth in him, periſh not, but may have Life everlaſting. For God ſent not his Son to judge</hi> (that is to Damn) <hi>the World; but that the World may be Sav'd by him:</hi> Or that which St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſays, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. 4. <hi>God will have all men Sav'd, and come to the knowledge of the Truth?</hi> How I ſay are theſe Divine Aſſertions true, if to bring Men to Salvation, God doth not ever preſerve a True Religion in the World? Doth not ever uphold the Truth of his Goſpel?</p>
            <p>For by Falſe Religions, no man can be Saved; in regard, that the Devil, and not God, is the Author and Suggeſtor of Falſe Religions, by which he intends the Damnation of Men, and not their Salvation, as is manifeſt. Yea, he neither can, neither will induce men, to invent a Religion able and fit, to Save men in. Mark this well, and alſo Note, that our Saviour, in the Sentence alleadg'd by the
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:95768:45"/> word <hi>World,</hi> doth not mean that only Age, in which He and his Apoſtles liv'd, nor thoſe Men only, which then liv'd: But all following Ages, and all that were to live, even till the day of Doom. All which, God would have to come to the knowledge of the Truth; namely, of his Divine Goſpel: And to ſave them all, he ſent his Bleſſed Son into the World. And therefore we muſt of neceſſity grant, that he provideth the People of all Ages, of a True and Illuſtrious Religion, by which they may be Sav'd: And that he ever preſerves, in all Ages, the Truth of his Goſpel (of which the Apoſtle ſpeaks in the Sentence alleadg'd) that ſo men may come to the knowledge thereof.</p>
            <p>For if the true Goſpel of Chriſt, be not extant in all Ages, how hath God a true Will and deſire, that the People of all Ages, ſhould come to the knowledge thereof? Neither is it ſufficient, that it be extant in the <hi>BIBLE,</hi> for all to come to the knowledge thereof: For all cannot read the <hi>Bible;</hi> neither can thoſe which are skill'd in Reading, thence pick out the true Goſpel, without the help of a True <hi>Interpreter,</hi> as I before have ſhew'd: But it muſt be ever extant in the Doctrine, and Teaching, of the Ordinary <hi>Doctors</hi> and <hi>Paſtors</hi> of the Church, whom others are bound to <hi>Hear and Obey,</hi> Luke 10. Heb. 13. And of whom they are to learn Divine Faith, which is gotten <hi>by Hearing,</hi> Rom. 10. which is clear out of <hi>Matth.</hi> 24. where Chriſt expreſly foretells, that his True Goſpel, <hi>(viz.)</hi> the ſame that he Taught, ſhould be <hi>Preached</hi> to all Nations, even till the end of the World, as I have before Noted: And therefore the True Goſpel muſt not lurk in the <hi>Bible,</hi> but be ever extant in the Preaching of the Church.</p>
            <p>Out of that which hath been ſpoken in this <hi>Queſtion,</hi> who doth not ſee, that the Prime and Fundamental Article, of the <hi>Proteſtant Religion,</hi> doth not only extreamly Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace the Wiſdom, Goodneſs and Mercy of God, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenuate
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:95768:46"/> the Merits of Chriſt; but doth alſo tend to the Denial of all Chriſtianity: to the utter neglect of God: Yea, and to plain <hi>Atheiſm</hi> it ſelf? For who will think, that the Son of God, really Dy'd for Mankind, if he gain'd ſo little for them? Or that there is a God, that doth truly Love Men, and tender their Good, if he be ſo mindleſs of them, and of their Eternal Happineſs and Salvation. The tending then of the <hi>Proteſtant Religion,</hi> ſo much to the Diſgrace of Chriſt, and of God, doth clearly ſhew, who was the firſt ſuggeſtor of it.</p>
            <p>Wherefore how certain it is, that there is a God, who is Infinitely Wiſe, Good and Merciful; and who doth truly Love Mankind, and tender their Eternal Good: And how certain it is, that Chriſt the Son of God, Died for us, took a moſt Provident courſe, for our Salvation; and that his Merits are of ineſtimable worth: So certain it is, that God hath ever preſerv'd in the World, a True, Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine and Illuſtrious Religion, in which Men may be Sav'd if they will. For Chriſt did not <hi>Light up a Candle to put it under a Buſhel,</hi> Mat. 5. And ſo certain it is, that the <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant Religion,</hi> which is Erected upon ſo bad a Founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion as the Erring of the Church is, is neither good, nor ſufficient to Salvation.</p>

            <head>Queſtion XIII. <hi>If the</hi> Church of Chriſt <hi>did Err, from the True Light of the Goſpel for ſo many Ages; could be find none fit, in ſo many hundred years, to reſtore the ſame, till</hi> Luther (<hi>falling out with the</hi> Pope, <hi>and breaking his </hi> Vow of Chaſtity,) <hi>began to Teach a New</hi> Religion <hi>tending to Liberty and Looſeneſs?</hi>
            </head>
            <p>TO make way for my next demand, I muſt again re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peat, that <hi>Proteſtants</hi> Believe and Teach; that the Church of Chriſt, quickly fell from that Purity of Doctrine, which he and his Apoſtles deliver'd unto her: And that ſhortly after their times, her Paſtors and Doctors, by Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Inventions, and Traditions, Obſcur'd the true and ſincere Light of the Goſpel: And obtruded upon their Fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers, many groſs Errors about Faith, many vain and hurtful Superſtitions, in the practice of Religion, and about the Worſhip of God. In which ſhe continu'd, ſtill increaſing them, for 1400, 1200. or at leaſt a thouſand years: And from which, ſhe ought long ago, to have been cleans'd, but was not, through the Ambition, Neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence, or groſs Ignorance, of her Paſtors. Who living in Blindneſs themſelves, lead their Followers in Blindneſs, as <hi>Proteſtants</hi> imagine. Who therefore call this long tract of time, in which they eſteem the Church to have Err'd, the time of Blindneſs: But how Blindly, may partly appear by that which I have already ſaid, partly by this.</p>
            <p>That thoſe Articles of the <hi>Old Religion,</hi> which theſe men account Errors, are the prime parts of the Religion of Chriſt, which tend to good Life, to nouriſh Piety, and to inflame
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:95768:47"/> Devotion; and which he ordain'd to Animate, Help, Curb, and Cure, our ſluggiſh, weak and frail Nature; and to bring his People, to live in the Fear of God, to walk in his Holy Commandments; to live according to Conſcience, to ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtain from Evil, and to do Good; To <hi>Crucifie the Fleſh and the bad Deſires thereof,</hi> Gal. 5. 24. And in a Word, to imitate ſtudiouſly his own Bleſſed Life, and the Lives and Actions of his Holy Apoſtles, and other prime Saints, who <hi>Forſook all to follow him,</hi> Mat. 19. 27.</p>
            <p>Such are thoſe Articles, of the <hi>Old Religion,</hi> which bind under pain of Damnation, to the neceſſity of keeping the Commandments of God (by abſtaining from Mortal Sins, ſuch as are Murder, Fornication, Theft in a notable quantity, Perjury, and the like, by which property they are broken) to the neceſſity of Faſting, as the Church Commands: Of Confeſſing all grievous ſins Sacramentally to a Lawful and Authoriz'd Prieſt; Of doing Pennance for them, in this Life, or of Suffering ſevere Puniſhment in the next: Of reſtoring other mens Goods unlawfully gotten, or poſſeſs'd; and to the neceſſity of obeying the Church, and all other Lawful Superiours, in things appertaining to their Power.</p>
            <p>Such alſo are thoſe Articles, which Teach the merit of good Works proceeding of Grace, and done in the ſtate of Grace; and the excellency of the Evangelical Councils of Chriſt, of perpetual Poverty, Chaſtity and Obedience, practic'd in the Church of Chriſt, even ſince the Apoſtles times, by innumerable Holy Men and Women.</p>
            <p>All which Articles, and divers others connex'd with theſe, are the things which <hi>Proteſtant</hi> Teachers repute Errors, and diſlike in the <hi>Old Religion;</hi> as reſtraining too much from the Liberty of the Goſpel; that is, (to ſpeak plain <hi>Engliſh)</hi> from the Liberty of the Fleſh, from <hi>Venus</hi> and <hi>Bacchus:</hi> Which Liberty is chiefly intrench'd upon, by the <hi>Roman Church,</hi> in that ſhe will not admit any to the high and Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:95768:47"/> Function of <hi>Prieſthood,</hi> who will not Voluntarily <hi>Geld themſelves for the Kingdom of Heaven,</hi> (Mat. 19. 12.) By Vowing perpetual Chaſtity; which point indeed doth chiefly ſting many <hi>Proteſtant Teachers,</hi> and doth incite them to rage ſo furiouſly, and to ſtand out ſo Rebelliouſly, as they do, againſt this their True and Antient Mother; though divers of the more Learned amongſt them, do it, with ſome Reluctation of Conſcience, which tells them, that Chaſtity is a Decent, dignifying and excellent Orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of <hi>Christian Prieſts;</hi> and which therefore not Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcurely foretells them, that the ſhort ſolace, which a Wife, in this Life affords them, is likely to coſt them in the next, the Eternal loſs of their Souls.</p>
            <p>But to come to the matter and queſtion here intended. If the Church of Chriſt did Err, from the true Light of his Goſpel, ſo many Ages, and imbrace ſo many groſs and dangerous Superſtitions (as She is accus'd to have done) I demand of Prudent and Conſiderate <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> how it could become the Wiſdom, Goodneſs and Mercy of God, firſt to drive off, and defer the Cleanſing and Reforming of his Church, ſo many hundred years, to the great Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honour of Himſelf, and of his Bleſſed Son, and to the loſs of Infinite Souls; and then after ſo long a tract of time, to make choice of ſuch Inſtruments, as <hi>Proteſtants</hi> imagine he did, to reſtore again to the World, the true Light of his Goſpel.</p>
            <p>Could he find none fit, to take in hand, and to bring to effect, this Needful, Merciful, and <hi>Holy Reformation,</hi> till <hi>Martin Luther,</hi> a Cholerick and Bold <hi>Auſtine-Fryer,</hi> In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cens'd with Anger, becauſe the Preaching of certain In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgences, granted by the <hi>Pope,</hi> was committed to the <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minican-Fryers,</hi> and not to his Order, fell out with the <hi>Pope;</hi> caſt away his Religious Weed, brake his Vow of Chaſtity, which he had long kept, Married a Nun Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crated
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:95768:48"/> to God, and plung'd himſelf into a Carnal courſe of Life?</p>
            <p>Could God, I ſay, find none fit, neither amongſt the Fathers of the Primitive Church, nor amongſt the Saints and Sages of the next thouſand years: to be the Actors, of ſo Needful a <hi>Reformation;</hi> till the Love of Carnal Liberty, made <hi>Luther</hi> and his Brood, ſhew themſelves to the World? There liv'd in thoſe times, St. <hi>Baſil</hi> the Great, St. <hi>Hierome,</hi> St. <hi>Ambroſe,</hi> St. <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> St. <hi>Gregory</hi> the Great, Venerable <hi>Bode,</hi> St. <hi>Bernard,</hi> St. <hi>Anſelme,</hi> St. <hi>Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas</hi> of <hi>Aquin,</hi> St. <hi>Bonaventure,</hi> beſide Innumerable others, all excellent Men, for Learning, Wiſdom, Sanctity; and all ſo Devoted to God, that He had them all at his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand: And yet among all theſe, could he find none ſo fit, to be his Inſtruments, in the Divine Work, of <hi>Reforming</hi> his <hi>Church,</hi> and of reſtoring again to the World, the true Light of his Goſpel, as <hi>Luther</hi> and his Aſſociates? Who dares Pawn his Soul hereon?</p>
            <p>Eſpecially if he conſider, that theſe Men, were not only deſtitute of Excellent Sanctity of Life, (which thoſe uſually have, who are Gods peculiar Inſtruments, in the effecting of any ſuch kind of work) but were alſo branded with all the Marks of Falſe Prophets, of Perfidious <hi>Hereticks,</hi> as Learned <hi>Proteſtants</hi> cannot but know: Inſomuch, that it is not poſſible for them to give a proper and True Definition of an <hi>Heretick,</hi> but therein they muſt involve, and incloſe <hi>Luther, Calvin, Zwinglius,</hi> and ſuch other prime Founders, of the <hi>Proteſtant Religion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>How improbable then a thing is it, that God among ſo many Wiſe, Learned and Holy Men, as flouriſh'd in his Church, in the long tract of above a thouſand years, could not find any fit, to be by him particularly imploy'd, for the reſtoring of the True Light of his Heavenly Religion, to the World again, (if it were loſt) till <hi>Luther</hi> and his

            <p>MY Fourteenth Demand is, Whether God by Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles, can move and draw Men to believe a falſe Religion, or no? Or thus, whether Men may ſafely, and without danger of their Souls, eſteem that Religion Falſe, VVicked, Pernicious, and worthy to be hated and perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted; to believe which, God doth ſtir up, and induce men, even by Miracles? as by curing the Lame, Blind, and the like. I think no underſtanding Proteſtant will be ſo ill adviſed, as to affirm this, for he that ſhould ſo do, ſhould utter a manifeſt Blaſphemy, tending to the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nial of God, and of all Chriſtianity. For he that draws men to believe falſe Religions, cannot be a good Spirit, but a Bad, cannot be God, but the Devil; (as is manifeſt,) or the Devils Agent, God being infinitely VViſe, Good, and True, and a zealous Hater of all Falſhood.</p>
            <pb n="72" facs="tcp:95768:49"/>
            <p> Moreover, what certainty can we have of the Truth of the Scriptures, of the Doctrine of <hi>Moſes,</hi> and of Chriſt; or that Chriſt was the true <hi>Meſſias,</hi> and Saviour of the VVorld, if God by Miracles, may draw and induce men to the imbracing of a falſe Religion? Far then be it from all true Chriſtian Breaſts, to hold ſo great a Blaſphemy as this; and therefore let me lay for a ſure and uncontroulable Ground, that God by Miracles cannot draw men to imbrace a falſe or bad Religion; and that therefore, that Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, to believe which, God by Miracles doth ſtir up, and induce, is not Bad, Superſtitious, and Falſe, but true, Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and Divine; yea, wholly True, and the only Saving Faith of Chriſt; becauſe there can be but only one Faith, but only one Religion in the VVorld, that is intirely True, and truly Saving, as I before have ſhewed. This Ground being agreed upon, which Chriſtianly cannot be denied, I propoſe to all prudent and conſiderate Proteſtants, this Syllogiſm.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>That Religion, to believe which, God by Miracles doth ſtir up, and draw, is wholly True, Divine and Saving. But God by Miracles, doth ſtir up, and draw men to believe Papiſtry:</hi> Ergo, <hi>Papistry is wholly true, Divine and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving;</hi> yea, it is the only Saving Faith of Chriſt. The <hi>Major</hi> is clear and certain, out of the Ground laid. The <hi>Minor</hi> I could prove by the Teſtimony of innumerable grave Authors, and by relating the Converſion of divers Heathen Nations to Chriſt, brought to paſs in former A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, and alſo in our Times. But omitting theſe, to avoid Prolixity, I will only inſiſt upon the Converſion of our own Nation to Chriſt, which was effected a thouſand years ago, by forty Holy Monks, ſent hither by <hi>Gregory</hi> the Great, then Biſhop of <hi>Rome,</hi> (St. <hi>Austin,</hi> the firſt Arch-Biſhop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> being the Cheif of them) who conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted our Fore-fathers, not to the <hi>Proteſtant Faith</hi> (which
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:95768:49"/> then was not ſo much as thought of in the VVorld, but to Papiſtry; for what Religion ſhould the <hi>Pope</hi> ſend in, and Monks bring in, but Papiſtry?</p>
            <p>This is manifeſt by the Churches, Altars, Abbeys, Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naſteries, Nunneries, which our firſt Chriſtians built. By the Names which they impoſed upon Churches, and upon ſundry Days of the Year; as <hi>Christmas, Aſh-Wedneſday, Palm-Sunday.</hi> By the <hi>Croſſes</hi> which they every where erected. By the <hi>Pictures,</hi> wherewith they adorned their Altars, and the <hi>Glaſs Windows</hi> of their Churches.

            <p>The ſame is clear out of the <hi>Magdeburgians, Luke Oſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander,</hi> and others, who ſhew, that ſcarcely there is a Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remony now uſed by Papiſts, that was not then brought in by St. <hi>Austin.</hi> And ſo there can no doubt be made, but that our Fore-fathers, by their firſt Converters, were
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:95768:50"/> made Papiſts, and that that Faith in Chriſt, to which God by his Grace did draw them, was <hi>Papistry.</hi> It reſts then to prove, that to this Faith, God did convert, and draw our Fore-fathers, even by Miracles. VVhich Point being well and firmly proved, no prudent man will deny, but that Papiſtry is truly and really a Holy and a Divine Reli<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>gion, yea, the true Light of the Goſpel, and the only Saving Faith of Chriſt, as my former Syllogiſm, doth de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrate.</p>
            <p>That God then by Miracles, did incline and draw our Fore-fathers to believe and imbrace that Faith and Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which <hi>Auſtin</hi> taught, that is, Papiſtry; is teſtified firſt by Venerable <hi>Bede,</hi> a Holy, Grave, and Learned Author, who living near the Time of our Converſion, while things were yet freſh in Memory, and writing out of the aſſured Records of the whole Buſineſs then extant, and to no meaner a Perſon than a King, is not likely to have erred through ignorance, or to have feigned. This wiſe then and Holy man, in his firſt Book, <hi>C.</hi> 26. ſpeaketh thus.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>But when the King himſelf, being much delighted with the Purity of their Life (namely, of</hi> Auguſtin and his Aſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciates) <hi>and the Example of their Godly Converſation, as alſo with their ſweet Promiſes, (which to be true, they proved by working many Miracles) did believe, and were Baptized; there began more and more daily to reſort unto their Sermons, and renouncing the Rites of their old Gentility, to joyn themſelves by Faith, to the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity of the Holy Church of Chriſt.</hi> Thus in this place, <hi>Bede.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Who in his Second Book, <hi>C.</hi> 2. relates a Famous Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle wrought by God, at the humble Petition of <hi>Auguſtin,</hi> to witneſs the Truth of that Religion, which he and his Aſſociates taught, which hapned thus. Bleſſed <hi>Austine</hi> being deſirous, not only to convert the Engliſh to Chriſt, but alſo to reform ſome Errors crept in amongſt the <hi>Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tans,</hi>
               <pb n="75" facs="tcp:95768:50"/> about the keeping of Eaſter, and the Ceremonies of Baptiſm, and to have the help of the <hi>Britans,</hi> in the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion of the <hi>Engliſh;</hi> procured a Meeting betwixt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf and the Learned of the <hi>Britains;</hi> at which, when after long Diſputation, the <hi>Britans</hi> would not yield; to bring the Matter to ſome iſſue, St. <hi>Auſtine</hi> ſaid.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Let us make our Prayers to God, who maketh of one Mind the Inhabitants of his Fathers Houſe; that he, by Heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Signs, would vouchſafe to ſhew which Tradition is to be followed, and by which way we ought to haſten towards his Kingdom. Let ſome ſick Body be brought hither, and by whoſe Prayers he ſhall be cured, let his Faith and Operation be esteemed by all, to be pleaſing to God, and to be that which we ought to follow. To which, though unwillingly his Adverſaries agreeing, a Blind man of the Engliſh Nation was brought, who being offered to the Britiſh Priests, and receiving no Help by their endeavours;</hi> Auſtin <hi>at length, by just neceſſity, compelled, bowed his Knees to the Father of oar Lord Jeſus Christ, beſeeching him, that he would reſtore to the Blind Man, the Sight he had lost, and by illumina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting one man corporally, would inkindle in the Hearts of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, the Light of Spiritual Grace. Preſently the Blind Man received his Sight, and</hi> Auſtin <hi>by all is proclaimed to be the true Preacher of Heavenly Light. Then the</hi> Britains <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed, that they perceived that</hi> Auſtin <hi>taught the true way of Juſtice, but they could not forſake their old Customs, without the Conſent of the reſt of their Side.</hi> Thus St. <hi>Bede.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>What will <hi>Protestants</hi> ſay then? Will they deny that this Miracle was wrought? Will they pawn their Souls that <hi>Bede</hi> recounts a Fable? I believe not, <hi>Bede</hi> being ſo Wiſe and Honeſt, the Meeting ſo Solemn, the Fact ſo Publick and Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous. What then, will they attribute this Miracle to the Devil? That indeed were deſperately done, <hi>Austine</hi> pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to Gon, and not to the Devil, and the Devil would
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:95768:51"/> think himſelf much honoured by them, for attributing ſo great Power unto him; for the Truth is, that although <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e can do many juggling Tricks, yet to reſtore Sight to he Blind, far ſurpaſſeth his Skill, and lies far without he Sphere of his Activity.</p>
            <p>Will they then yield to the Truth, and admit that both the Miracle was wrought, and that it was the Work of God? If this they grant, they alſo muſt admit, that <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſtry</hi> is the <hi>true Religion of Christ;</hi> and ſo they muſt not only leave to hate and perſecute <hi>Papiſts,</hi> but <hi>Papists</hi> alſo they muſt become, unleſs they will run head-long to eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Perdition; for God wrought this great Miracle to teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie, that That was the true Religion, and the right way to Salvation, which <hi>Austine</hi> taught. And what taught he? <hi>Papistry</hi> certainly, even plain <hi>Papistry,</hi> as I before did ſhew, even by the Confeſſion of Learned <hi>Proteſtants. Papistry</hi> then is the true <hi>Religion,</hi> if Credit be to be gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to God.</p>
            <p>The Second that I bring to witneſs St. <hi>Auſtines</hi> Miracles, is St. <hi>Gregory</hi> the Great, a Holy, Learned, and wiſe Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late, of whom <hi>Bede</hi> thus relateth, <hi>Lib.</hi> 1. <hi>c.</hi> 31. <hi>At which time</hi> Gregory <hi>ſent unto</hi> Auſtine <hi>an Epiſtle, concerning the Miracles</hi> which he knew were done by him. <hi>In which, (that through the Multitude of them, he ſhould not come within the danger of Vain-glory) he exhorts him with theſe Words. I know my most dear Brother, that the Omnipotent God, by thy dilection, doth ſhew great Miracles toward that Nation, which he hath choſen. Whence it is needful, that for the ſame Heavenly Gift, thou ſhouldſt Joy with Fear, and Fear with Joy. Rejoyce becauſe the Souls of the Engliſh, by theſe out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Miracles, are drawn to inward Grace. But Fear, (leaſt among theſe Signs, which are done) thy weak Mind elevate it ſelf thorough Preſumption, and while without it is raiſed to Honour, within it fall into Vain-glory.</hi> And again, <hi>Whatſoever</hi>
               <pb n="77" facs="tcp:95768:51"/> 
               <hi>Power, in working Miracles, thou haſt, or ſhalt receive, eſteem, the ſame to be bestowed, not on Thee, but on Them, for whoſe Salvation thou hast it.</hi> Thus in this Epiſtle St. <hi>Gregory,</hi> where I would beſeech every conſiderate Proteſtant, to weigh maturely with himſelf, whether it be likely, that ſo Grave, Eminent, Conſcientious, and VVary a Prelate, as Great St. <hi>Gregory</hi> was, would have written thus to <hi>Auſtine,</hi> if he had not been well inform'd, by ſure and certain teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies, of the Multitude of Miracles wrought by him, for the Converſion of the Engliſh?</p>
            <p>So certain indeed, was this Holy Doctor, of the Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles of <hi>Austine,</hi> that he feared not to inſert ſome mention of them, into his Famous VVork upon <hi>Job,</hi> as <hi>Bede</hi> teſtifies, <hi>Lib.</hi> 2. <hi>c.</hi> 1. <hi>Behold,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>the Tongue of the Engliſh, which lately knew nothing, but to mutter barbarouſly, now hath begun to reſound in the Praiſes of God, the Hebrew Alleluja,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Becauſe by Precepts, by Heavenly Words, and alſo by ſhining Miracles, the Virtue of Divine Knowledge is infuſed into them. By which Words,</hi> ſaith <hi>Bede, Bleſſed</hi> Gregory <hi>declares, that</hi> St. Auſtine <hi>and his Aſſociates, did bring the Engliſh Nation to the Knowledge of the Truth, not only by the outward ſound of Words, but alſo by the help of Heavenly Miracles.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>VVhich Holy <hi>Gregory</hi> teſtifieth alſo, to <hi>Eulogius</hi> Patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ark of <hi>Alexandria.</hi> To whom, relating with joy, the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion of the Engliſh. <hi>Lib.</hi> 7. <hi>Epiſtol.</hi> 30. <hi>Indict.</hi> 1. <hi>Know then,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>that whereas the Engliſh Nation,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed hitherto in Infidelity, I did by the help of your Prayers,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>ſend unto that Nation</hi> (Auſtine) <hi>a Monk of my Monastery, to Preach to them.</hi> &amp;c. <hi>And now Letters are come to us, both of his Health, and of the Work he hath in hand. And ſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, either He, or they which were ſent with him, work ſo many Miracles in that Nation, as they may ſeem to imitate therein the Power and Miracles of the Apostles themſelves.</hi> Thus to <hi>Eulogius Gregorius.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="78" facs="tcp:95768:52"/>
            <p> By whoſe moſt grave, and ſo often iterated Teſtimony, as alſo by, St. <hi>Bedes,</hi> it ſeems to be convinced, that <hi>Auſtine</hi> and his Aſſociates, did draw the Engliſh to Papiſtry, not only by the Sanctity of their Lives, and by Preaching, but alſo by great ſtore of divine and undoubted Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles, even ſuch as were like to the Miracles of the Apoſtles.</p>
            <p>But that which ſtriketh this matter dead, and which proves undeniably, the intercourſe of Divine Miracles, in our Converſion to Chriſt, is the Epitaph placed upon the Sepulchre of Bleſſed <hi>Auſtine,</hi> ſhortly after his Death. For who can perſwade himſelf, that King <hi>Ethelbert,</hi> newly then converted, and full of Divine Zeal, and of the Love of the Truth, would permit, or the Holy Biſhops which St. <hi>Auſtin</hi> left behind him, attempt to inſcribe upon his Tomb, notorious Lies and Fictions, to the Scandal of the King and his People, in the Infancy of their Chriſtianity, which many then living could eaſily have controulled, if a VVorker of Miracles <hi>Auſtine</hi> had not been? But hear the Epitaph recorded by <hi>Bede, Lib.</hi> 2. <hi>c.</hi> 3.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Here resteth Bleſſed</hi> Auſtine, <hi>the firſt Arch-biſhop of</hi> Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terbury, <hi>who was ſent hether by Bleſſed</hi> Gregory, <hi>Biſhop of</hi> Rome, <hi>and aided by God with the Operation of Miracles, did bring King</hi> Ethelbert <hi>and his People from the Worſhip of Idols, to the Faith of Chriſt, and fulfilling in Peace the Days of his Office; dyed the Seventh of the</hi> Calends <hi>of</hi> June, <hi>the ſame King yet Reigning.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus the Epitaph, into which no man of VVit, Modeſty, or Honeſty, would have inſerted the Gift of Miracles, if it had not been notoriouſly true, that this our Apoſtle was therewith adorned, and by the help thereof, did convert the Engliſh from Idolatry to the Faith of Chriſt.</p>
            <pb n="81" facs="tcp:95768:52"/>
            <p> And ſo it reſteth inevitably proved, that God by Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles did draw our Fore-fathers to <hi>Papiſtry.</hi> Whence it as evidently followeth, yea much more evidently, that Papi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry is a Divine and Holy Religion, intirely True, and really the True Light of the Goſpel, and the only ſaving Faith of Chriſt; which no Man can Hate, Impugne, Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecute, without the high offence of God, and extream pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ril of his own Soul. This, I ſay, is moſt clearly proved, and evicted, by the Argument drawn from the Miracles, which it pleas'd God to work, for the Converſion of the <hi>Engliſh.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Neither let any Proteſtant flatter, and delude himſelf, by thinking, that a ſatisfying Anſwer may be made there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto, for certainly it cannot; for neither can it be deny'd, with any colour of Truth, that ſuch Miracles were done, for the Converſion of the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> as are certified by <hi>Bede,</hi> by <hi>Gregory,</hi> by the Epitaph. Neither can it be maintained, that God by Miracles may draw Men to a falſe and wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Religion: And as impoſſible it is to prove, that the Devil was the Author of the Miracles wrought by Saint <hi>Auſtin.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For if the Devil could never yet effect ſuch Miracles, to draw Men to falſe and wicked Religions, as to Judaiſm, Arianiſm, Turciſm, Paganiſm, or to the direct and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs worſhip of himſelf: How great madneſs is it to think, that he wrought theſe Miracles, to draw Men from himſelf to Chriſt? From the worſhip of Falſe Gods, to the worſhip of the True God?</p>
            <p>If any protern and wrangling Wit, will reply, that the Devil effected theſe Miracles, not to draw Men to Chriſt, but to Papiſtry, which contains the worſhip of Saints and Angels, a thing very pleaſing to the Devil. I demand, whether it be more pleaſing to the Devil, and diſpleaſing to God, to have Chriſt worſhipped for God, and his Angels and
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:95768:53"/> Saints honoured, (not as Gods, (for that is the Fiction of Proteſtants, not the Fact of Papiſts,) but as ſanctified Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, dear to God, and by his Grace Dignify'd, and made worthy of Reſpect and Honour,) then to have wicked Men, ſenſeleſs Creatures, the Devil himſelf worſhipped for Gods? May not a Jew, a Villain, a Miſcreant wrangle, according to this Example, and ſay, That the Miracles, which are ſaid to have been wrought by Chriſt and his Apoſtles, were wrought indeed by the Devil, to draw Men from the True Worſhip of God, preſcribed by the Law of <hi>Moſes,</hi> to the Falſe Worſhip of a Crucify'd Man? Far then be it from the hearts of prudent and ſober Men, to attribute to the Devil, the manifeſt works of the Holy Ghoſt, ſo to maintain a Faction, (to their own Perdition,) againſt the True and Saving Faith of Chriſt, proved moſt clearly by the Miracles of S. <hi>Auſtin,</hi> to be no other, but the <hi>Roman Catholick Faith,</hi> ſtyled by <hi>Proteſtants, Papiſtry,</hi> and <hi>Popery.</hi>

            <p>BEcauſe divers Proteſtants, eſpecially of the purer ſtrain, eſteem themſelves to be the Elect of the Lord; and adorn, not ſeldom, their Brotherhood, with this goodly Title: That theſe Men may ſee the folly of this their proud preſumption, I demand, Whether the Elect of God, are to be gathered out of all Ages, and out of all the Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of the World: Or, out of ſome few Ages, and out of ſome ſmall Parcel of the World? If they are to be gather<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed only out of ſome little part of the World: How is that true, which our Saviour ſays, <hi>Matth.</hi> 24. 31. <hi>And he</hi> (the Son of God,) <hi>ſhall ſend his Angels with a Trumpet, and a great Voice: And they ſhall gather together his Elect from the four Winds, from the fartheſt parts of Heaven, even to the ends thereof?</hi> Or that true, which the Elect themſelves ſay, <hi>Rev.</hi> 5. 9. <hi>Thou art worthy, O Lord, to take the Book, and to open the Seals thereof: Becauſe thou waſt ſlain, and haſt redeemed us to God, in thy blood, out of every Tribe, and Tongue, and People, and Nation?</hi> Or that which St. <hi>John</hi> ſays, <hi>Rev.</hi> 7. 9. <hi>After theſe things, I ſaw a great mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude, which no Man could Number, of all Nations, and Tribes, and People, and Tongues, ſtanding before the Throne,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>How, I ſay, are theſe moſt expreſs places of God's Word true, if his Elect are to be gathered only out of ſome ſmall Parcel of the World, poſſeſſed by the purer ſort of <hi>Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants?</hi> But if according to theſe expreſs and clear places, the true Elect of God, are to be gathered out of all the
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:95768:54"/> quarters of the World, and Nations of the Earth; as moſt certainly they are: How dangerous is the ſtate of all <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants</hi> and how ridiculous the preſumption of thoſe Pure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings, who being but Birds of Yeſterdays Hatching, and Neſtled only in a Corner of the World, will needs be, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſooth, the Elect of the Lord, and the only Gueſts that muſt be admitted to his Banquet?</p>
            <p>But let not <hi>Proteſtants</hi> here deceive themſelves, by ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gining, that although for many Ages, they were not extant, not ever hitherto ſpread over the World; yet that here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after they ſhall arrive to this happineſs. For firſt, If God hath not yet made uſe of their endeavours, to convert the Heathen Nations of the Earth to his Son; when is it likely that he will change his Stile, and rejecting his old Work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, imploy the Leaden Zeal of theſe new, Laborers ſhall I ſay, or Loyterers?</p>
            <p>2. When will the Needle of theſe Mens Zeal, point toward the Converſion of Heathen Nations; ſeeing that when it was newly touched, and in it ſelf moſt vigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous and active, it only turned toward the perverting of old Chriſtians, never minding the miſery of Heathens?</p>
            <p>3. What real hope can there be, that <hi>Proteſtant Tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers,</hi> will ever ſpread their Religion over the World, by converting Heathen Nations to Chriſt; ſeeing they are deſtitute of <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity in Doctrine,</hi> of excellent Sanctity of Life, and of the gift of Miracles? All which are neceſſary for the effecting, of ſo hard and Divine a work, as the Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of Heathen Nations is; as is manifeſt by the Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of the Apoſtles, and of all the excellent Labourers of the <hi>Catholick Church:</hi> Which hitherto have been the Converters of Heathen Nations? Certainly none at all. And as little ſolid hope can <hi>Proteſtants</hi> have, that they ſhall one day be gathered together, by the Holy Angels, and placed amongſt the Elect of God?</p>
            <pb n="85" facs="tcp:95768:54"/>
            <p> For certain it is, that the Elect of God, are to be gather<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out of the Profeſſors of the True Faith and Religion of Chriſt: (which is but one, as I have already ſhewed, and as the Apoſtle affirms, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4. 5. <hi>One Faith, one Baptiſm, one God,)</hi> and out of his True Church, and Fold. Which alſo is but one, as he himſelf doth teach, <hi>John</hi> 10. 16. <hi>And other Sheep I have, that are not of this Fold: Them alſo I muſt bring, and they ſhall hear my voice; And there ſhall be made one Fold, and one Paſtor.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Out of which words, note, Firſt, That Chriſt ſpeaking of his Church, as ſhe was to be, after the Conjunction of the Jews and Gentiles together in one Faith, aſſures us, that ſhe ſhould be <hi>One Fold;</hi> namely, under one Viſible Head, one Juriſdiction, one Government, having one Faith, one Worſhip of God, one Communion, one means of San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctification, for the Flock of this Fold.</p>
            <p>Note, Secondly, That by this <hi>One Paſtor,</hi> that was to be made, after Chriſt ſpake theſe words, may well be meant, (not only Chriſt himſelf; who was then the <hi>Good Paſtor,</hi> ver. 11. and was not ſo made after this time,) but ſome other Supreme Miniſterial Paſtor, made by Chriſt, after the ſpeaking of theſe words, to preſerve Unity in his Church; and fittingly to govern her, under himſelf: Which was no other, but bleſſed <hi>Peter,</hi> made Supreme Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtor, of the Flock of Chriſt, <hi>John</hi> 21. which Office he left to his Succeſſors.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, note, That the Voice of the Church of Chriſt, preaching in all Ages to the Nations of the Earth, to bring them to his Fold, is the Voice of Chriſt, by his own ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgement: <hi>And they,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>ſhall hear my Voice:</hi> According to that of <hi>Luk.</hi> 10. 16. <hi>He that heareth you, hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth me.</hi> And ſo Chriſt hath hitherto preached, and doth yet preach to the Gentiles, not by his own Corporal and Perſonal Voice, but by the Voice of his Apoſtles, and of
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:95768:55"/> their Succeſſors, the Ordinary Doctors and Paſtors of his Church: Whoſe Voice is his Voice, becauſe by him they are ſent to teach, and by him in their teaching are Guided. And in like manner, the ſound of the Apoſtles doth yet go forth into all the Earth, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 18. <hi>Rom.</hi> 10. And muſt go forth even till the day of Doom, for a Teſtimony to all Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, <hi>Matth.</hi> 24. 14.</p>
            <p>Now then, ſeeing that the <hi>Elect of God,</hi> are to be ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered out of all the World, and out of the Fold and Flock of Chriſt: And that Chriſt verily and really hath but one Fold, one Church, one Faith, one Flock, and one Supreme Paſtor under himſelf, to guide fittingly this large Fold, this great and numerous Flock, ſpread over the VVorld; And ſeeing alſo, that the Proteſtants are neither ſpread over the VVorld, that the <hi>Elect of God</hi> may be gathered out of them; nor united to that Flock, nor participants of that Faith which is ſpread over the VVorld; nor within that Fold, that is One, nor under the Government and Feeding of that one Supreme Paſtor, of whom Chriſt ſpeaketh: Deplorable for the preſent is their Caſe, moſt dangerous their State, vain their Labour, and fruitleſs their Hope: And ſo it will ever be, until they return to this Flock and Paſtor again.

            <p>THe Doctrine delivered to Chriſtian People, concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Heaven and Hell, doth teach the one to be a place of ſuch unſpeakable Happineſs: And the other of ſuch inexplicable Miſery, that no diſcreet Man among them, will ſtick to ſay, (if he be asked,) that every Man and VVoman, doth ſtand moſt deeply obliged, out of their Duty to God, and the natural Love they owe to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, to take the ſurer way, when doubt is made, to gain the one, and to avoid the other.</p>
            <p>To take, I ſay, the ſurer way, when doubt is made about the ways, which are ſaid to lead to Heaven, or to bring to Hell. Amongſt which ways, two are of chief eſteem, the <hi>Catholick</hi> and the <hi>Proteſtant,</hi> the <hi>Old</hi> and the <hi>New Religion.</hi> Both which are ſaid to be ſure ways to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven; yet both are doubted of. The <hi>Old</hi> is doubted of, among Chriſtians, only by a few of the <hi>Proteſtant Party,</hi> who are neither of the beſt Learned amongſt them, nor of the moſt diſcreet. For <hi>Learned Proteſtants</hi> generally hold, that the <hi>Old Religion,</hi> that is, <hi>Papiſtry,</hi> is a <hi>Saving Religion,</hi> and a ſecure way to Heaven; and that thoſe which live and dye therein may be ſaved. Here this wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſed by their own Pens; and, firſt, by Doctor <hi>Covel</hi> in his defence of Mr. <hi>Hooker</hi>'s Books of <hi>Eccleſiastical Polity,</hi>
               <pb n="88" facs="tcp:95768:56"/> Publiſhed by Authority: Where he teacheth this at large, ſaying, Page 77. <hi>We affirm them of the Church of</hi> Rome, <hi>to be part of the Church of Chriſt; and that thoſe which live and dye in that Church, may notwithſtanding be ſaved.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The ſame is taught by Doctor <hi>Field,</hi> in his Third Book of the Church, cap. 46. pag. 182. ſaying, <hi>We doubt not, but the Church, in which the Biſhop of</hi> Rome, <hi>with more then</hi> Lucifer-like <hi>Pride exalted himſelf, was notwithſtanding the True Church of God: And that it held a ſaving Profeſſion of truth in Chriſt; and by force thereof, did Convert many from Errour.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And by Doctor <hi>Some,</hi> in his defence againſt <hi>Penry,</hi> pag. 182. ſaying, <hi>In the Judgement of all Learned Men, and all Reformed Churches, there is in Popery a Church, a Miniſtry, a True Chriſt.</hi> And <hi>pag.</hi> 176. <hi>If you think,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>that all the Popiſh ſort, which died in the Popiſh Church, are damned, you think abſurdly, and diſſent from the Judgement of Lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned Proteſtants.</hi> Thus theſe Prime and Learned Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants; to whom I could add many more of later date, but that it is needleſs, in regard that all moderate <hi>Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants</hi> do grant, that Papiſts may be ſaved.</p>
            <p>Yea, this is the common Tenet of all Learned <hi>Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants,</hi> and of all <hi>Reformed Churches,</hi> as you have heard out of Doctor <hi>Somes.</hi> And not without cauſe, in regard that <hi>Learned Proteſtants</hi> ſee well enough, that if this they ſhould deny, they ſhould not only very raſhly, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any ſure ground, condemn to Hell all their Fore-fathers, and the reſt of the Chriſtian World, for above a Thouſand Years before <hi>Luther,</hi> (not being well able to ſave from this Cenſure, the <hi>Antient Fathers,</hi> and innumerable other Learned Men, and Holy Saints,) but ſhould alſo lay open a fair way to plain <hi>Atheiſm;</hi> to the utter denial of Chriſt, and of God; as my Tenth, Eleventh, and Twelfth <hi>Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtions,</hi> do very clearly demonſtrate.</p>
            <pb n="89" facs="tcp:95768:56"/>
            <p> And therefore I may, without danger of ſlander, affirm, That thoſe Proteſtants which deny Papiſtry to be a ſaving Religion, and hold that Papiſts are not ſaved, are neither of the beſt Learned, nor of the Wiſeſt ſort. For if they were Learned, they would eaſily gather out of the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of the Scriptures, and the Hiſtories of the Chriſtian Church, that to deny Papiſtry to be a ſaving Religion, is to deny Chriſt, in effect, as I have before ſhewed. And if they were diſcreet and wiſe, they would not ſo raſhly condemn, to the pit of Hell, the whole Chriſtian World; together with their Fore-fathers, for ſo many hundreds of years, in which Papiſtry reigned over the World, without any firm ground, or urgent reaſon at all. Unleſs their own miſtaking, and ignorance, muſt be reputed a firm ground.</p>
            <p>For ſetting theſe aſide, (by which their miſ-informed, and miſ-guided Zeal, doth take Papiſtry to be that which it is not) what can they bring firm and ſolid, to prove that Papiſtry is not a ſaving Religion? Will they ſay, that Papiſts are ignorant of, or do not rely upon a certain ſpecial Faith, by which they eſteem themſelves to be the Elect of God; and to be Cock-ſure of Salvation? Be it ſo. Neither did the Prophets, nor the Apoſtles, nor the Ancient Fathers, rely upon this ſpecial Faith, as is evident by their Lives: For they applied themſelves to Holy Works, to much Prayer, to frequent Faſting, to great Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterity and Mortification, ſeeking by theſe means, to make ſure their Vocation, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 10. and really working their Salvation in fear and trembling, as the Apoſtle adviſeth, <hi>Philip.</hi> 2. 12. For all which Labour, Care and Auſterity, this ſpecial Faith is a <hi>Superſedeas,</hi> as is manifeſt by the Lives and Actions, of thoſe which rely thereon.</p>
            <p>Wherefore, if for want of this <hi>Sin-nouriſhing ſpecial Faith,</hi> Papiſts do periſh, both Patriarchs, Prophets, Apoſtles, and
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:95768:57"/> the Ancient Fathers; yea all the Saints and Holy Servants of God, which lived from <hi>Adam</hi>'s time to <hi>Luther,</hi> muſt pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh with them. For none of theſe were acquainted with, or relyed upon this ſpecial Faith. Otherwiſe there would have been clear, and manifeſt mention thereof, in the Holy Scriptures; in which the Holy Ghoſt, not once or twice, but moſt frequently would have inculcated the ſame, if it had been ſo needful, that without it, Men could not be ſaved. But ſeeing that in all his Divine Word, he hath made no clear mention thereof, Papiſts cannot be in dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, for not relying thereon. But rather thoſe which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye thereon, are in manifeſt danger of Eternal Perdition; becauſe in ſo weighty a buſineſs, as their Everlaſting Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs is; they forſaking the received Doctrine of the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian World, in the point of Juriſdiction, rely upon a meer chimerical Fiction of their own, as at their death they will find.</p>
            <p>What then; will theſe Zealous Preciſians exclude Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts from Heaven, becauſe they commit Idolatry? But this foul and fooliſh Crime, Papiſts do no where commit, but in theſe Mens miſtaking Brains, as is evident to all that know what Papiſts believe. But Papiſts, they will ſay, do Err in divers points of Religion; and therefore they cannot be ſaved. But do not all Churches Err, in theſe Mens conceipt? Are not all ſubject to Erring? Let them then either yield, that Erring Religions are ſaving; or elſe let them boldly teach, That Jeſus Chriſt, hath not provided the World of any means of Salvation; ſeeing he hath not eſtabliſhed therein, (as theſe Men imagine) any Religion, that is not Erring. By all which it is clear, that in theſe parts of the World, none do doubt, but that Papi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry is a Saving Religion, ſaving a few unlearned Preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſians, who doubt of this, but very indiſcreetly, as I have ſhewed.</p>
            <pb n="91" facs="tcp:95768:57"/>
            <p> But on the contrary, all the Papiſts in the World, (who are far more in number, than the Proteſtants are, and real<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly far excel them in Learning,) do not doubt, whether the Proteſtant Religion be Saving, or no; but moſt firmly hold, upon ſure and undeceiving Grounds, that it is not; and that therefore no Man can be Saved, preciſely by the help of this Religion. Which makes ſo many underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Men and Women, that know it right well, forſake it, notwithſtanding that it is ſo eaſie, and ſo pleaſiing to Fleſh and Blood; and to imbrace <hi>Papiſtry,</hi> far leſs agreeable to their Senſual Appetites, with ſo great hazard of their Quiet, Preferments, Liberty and Goods. Which certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly they would never do, but to ſecure their Souls. Which ſecurity, if the <hi>Proteſtant Religion</hi> were able to afford, no Man of Wit, here in <hi>England,</hi> would forſake the ſame, to become a <hi>Catholick.</hi> But no ſuch ſecurity is to be found in this Religion, but rather certain danger of Eternal Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, as all do find, that throughly ſearch into it.</p>
            <p>Neither are <hi>Papiſts,</hi> for thus Cenſuring of the <hi>Proteſtant Religion,</hi> to be eſteemed leſs charitable, then thoſe <hi>Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants,</hi> which brand not <hi>Papiſtry</hi> with ſo hard a Cenſure: For the Caſe of <hi>Papiſts</hi> and <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> in this Affair, is not alike: Becauſe <hi>Proteſtants</hi> in believing, are at liberty, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to their own Poſitions; in regard, That as they do not hold, that there is upon Earth any Un-erring Church, whoſe teaching all are bound to follow, under pain of Damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation: So they do not eſteem themſelves bound to believe ſtrictly, the teaching of any Church; or to think, that Errors in Points of Faith do indanger Salvation.</p>
            <p>But <hi>Papiſts</hi> are not at the like liberty, becauſe they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving, that the <hi>Catholick Church,</hi> (which is no other than that Church, which being ſpread over the World, is joined in Communion to the Chair of <hi>Peter,)</hi> cannot Err in her Doctrine of Faith, by reaſon of the continual aſſiſtance of
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:95768:58"/> the Holy Ghoſt; do eſteem themſelves bound to believe as ſhe teaches. And therefore becauſe this Church, (guided by the Holy Ghoſt, and directed by the Holy Scriptures,) doth teach, that there is but <hi>One Faith,</hi> Epheſ. 4. but <hi>One Fold,</hi> Joh. 10. That Chriſtian People are bound, under pain of Damnation, to <hi>Obey their Lawful Prelates,</hi> Heb. 13. And <hi>to hear the Voice of the Church,</hi> Matth. 18. And to <hi>liſten</hi> to the Ordinary <hi>Paſtors thereof,</hi> Luk. 10. And that they are in like ſort bound to beware of falſe Prophets, that is falſe Expounders of God's Word; to avoid <hi>Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical Teachers,</hi> ſuch as their Church hath declared, <hi>Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant Teachers</hi> to be: For theſe, and the like reſpects, Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholicks do reſolutely hold, (if they be ſuch as underſtand their own Religion,) that by the help, preciſely, of the <hi>Proteſtant Religion,</hi> no Man can be ſaved.</p>
            <p>Which they hold not for want of Charity, but for Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to the Word of God, and to the True and Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Church of Chriſt. Let not then <hi>Proteſtants</hi> blame <hi>Catholicks,</hi> for believing as they do, ſeeing the word of God, and ſo great Authority doth force them thereunto. But rather let them blame themſelves, for following new Teachers, contrary to the Doctrine of the Scriptures; and for diſ-uniting themſelves, from the True and Catholick Church of Chriſt; out of whoſe Communion, there is No Salvation, as our Creeds do teach.</p>
            <p>By all which, it ſees to be clear, that the <hi>Old Religion</hi> of the Chriſtian World, called <hi>Papiſtry,</hi> wherein aſſuredly our Forefathers were Saved, is far a ſurer way to Eternal Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs, then the <hi>New</hi> and <hi>Proteſtant Profeſſion</hi> is; in regard that all Learned Men agree, both <hi>Proteſtants</hi> and <hi>Papiſts,</hi> that <hi>Papiſtry</hi> is a <hi>Saving Religion:</hi> Whereas all Learned <hi>Papiſts,</hi> (who are far the greater and the Learneder num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,) upon ſure grounds affirm, That no Man can be Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by the help of the <hi>Proteſtant Religion.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="93" facs="tcp:95768:58"/>
            <p> Which being ſo, I demand firſt, with what ſecurity of Conſcience, do <hi>Proteſtants</hi> hate, revile, tread under foot and perſecute the Old Religion, ſeeing it is a ſecure way to Salvation, even by the Judgment of all Learned <hi>Proteſtants?</hi> May any Man, without offending God, perſecute the Children of God, and ſeek to ruine that Religion, by which the Holy Ghoſt doth Sanctifie and Save Souls? Can this be accounted Charity towards God, Charity towards our Neighbour? Nay, ſeeing that <hi>Proteſtants</hi> cannot deny, but that it is far the ſecurer, and ſurer way to Eternal Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, to live and dye <hi>Papiſts,</hi> than to live and dye <hi>Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants;</hi> with what Chriſtian Piety, do <hi>Perſecuting Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants,</hi> afflict <hi>Catholicks,</hi> for taking, in the great Affair of Salvation,) the ſurer and ſecurer way?</p>
            <p>Secondly, I demand, what Light of Reaſon, what Duty towards God, what Charity toward themſelves, doth lead <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> not to take the ſurer way for their own Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, they having ſo juſt cauſe to doubt, that their <hi>New Proteſtant Profeſſion,</hi> is not ſecure? Do they not know, that many Learned <hi>Catholicks</hi> have indured Impriſonments, Fetters, Tortures, Cruel Butchering of their Bodies, and loſs of their Lives, rather than they would hazard their Souls, in the <hi>Proteſtant Religion?</hi> Do they not ſee, that many Prudent, underſtanding, Generous, and Noble <hi>Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licks,</hi> did ſuffer diſgrace, indured Vexations, ſuſtained the Abridging of their Liberties, and loſs of their Goods, rather than they would hazard their Souls among them?</p>
            <p>Moreover, do they not ſee, how little Unity in Doctrine, how little Sanctity of Life, how ſmall Reſemblance, of the holy Life and Virtues of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and of his <hi>Apostles,</hi> how little immitation of the <hi>Antient Fathers,</hi> there is in the <hi>Teachers,</hi> and prime <hi>Profeſsors</hi> of the <hi>Proteſtant Religion?</hi> Do they not know how great a decay of <hi>Humility,</hi> of <hi>Charity,</hi>
               <pb n="94" facs="tcp:95768:59"/> of <hi>Chaſtity,</hi> of <hi>Sobriety,</hi> of <hi>Neighbourhood,</hi> of <hi>Juſtice,</hi> of <hi>Fidelity,</hi> of <hi>Conſeience,</hi> the <hi>Proteſtant Belief</hi> hath brought into the World? Do they not know, that falſe <hi>Teachers,</hi> are known by their Fruits? And that there is but <hi>One Truth?</hi> All this they know and ſee; and therefore if they will but conſult with reaſon, and not be lead by fancy, or blinded by affection; they cannot but judge, that to live and dye in the <hi>New</hi> and <hi>Proteſtant Religion,</hi> is far leſs ſecure, for their Souls, then to live and dye in the <hi>Old</hi> and <hi>Catholick Faith:</hi> And conſequently, they cannot but know, that the tender care, which they are bound to have of their own Souls, and of the Eternal Salvation of them, doth put upon them a great obligation to become <hi>Catholicks,</hi> and to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn to the Faith of their Fore-fathers, ſo to ſecure thoſe their moſt precious Jewels; which in their <hi>New Profeſſion</hi> can never be truly ſecured, as the Doctrine of this little Treatiſe doth clearly demonſtrate. But rather they lye expoſed moſt certainly to the miſery of Eternal Perdition; whereas in the <hi>Catholick Profeſsion,</hi> they may certainly ſecure them, by the Judgement, not only of the whole <hi>Catholick Church of Chriſt;</hi> but alſo of all <hi>Learned Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To the Arguments, which ſupport the ſtrength of this Treatiſe, I could add others not of Inferior force, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrate, the Happineſs of <hi>Catholicks,</hi> the Unhappineſs and danger of <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> ariſing from their Faith and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion. But that which hath been ſaid is abundantly ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient, to give Light to all, who willingly will not be blind. And therefore I here end my preſent endeavours for Truth and Peace: To which if any <hi>Proteſtant</hi> will frame an Anſwer.</p>
            <p>I require of him <hi>Firſt,</hi> that he abſtain from Railing. <hi>Secondly,</hi> That he abſtain from Feigning, and from help<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his Cauſe by Impoſtures. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> That by vain Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertinencies,
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:95768:59"/> and Retorical Digreſſions, he ſeek not to loſe and to dazle the Eyes, of Weak and leſs Judicious Readers. <hi>Fourthly,</hi> That he make not vain Flouriſhes, by Citing ſome broken, or miſtaken Sentences, out of the Antient Fathers, againſt me. For I will not allow him to meddle with them, but upon two conditions. The one is, that he ſhall Tye himſelf, and his Church, to ſtand to the Arbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triment, of thoſe clear Lights of the Church of Chriſt, in points Controverted betwixt <hi>Catholicks</hi> and <hi>Proteſtants.</hi> For if he, will not be ſtinted by them, why ſhould I?</p>
            <p>The other is, that he ſhall allow, the Ordinary Doctors and Paſtors of the preſent <hi>Catholick Church,</hi> to be of equal Authority, with thoſe Antient VVorthies, in matters ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertaining to Faith; not in matters Hiſtorical. For thoſe Antients, are better VVitneſſes, of what the Apoſtles Taught and Practic'd, than thoſe which now live can be: But yet they are not ſurer Interpreters of Gods VVord, in matters of Faith; nor ſurer Explicators, and Propoſers of the Articles, of the ſame Faith, than the preſent Doctors and Paſtors of the Church are.</p>
            <p>This may ſeem to ſome a Paradox; and yet it is no more, then what the Rules of True <hi>Theology,</hi> do warrant me to affirm. For thoſe Antient Doctors, were not ſure Guides in matters of Religion, by the ſtrength of their own VVits, or Excellency of their Learning, but by the aſſiſtance of the Holy Ghoſt; which neceſſary aſſiſtance, in explaining and propoſing Articles of Faith, the Ordinary Doctors and Paſtors of the preſent Church, have equally with them. For Chriſt did not Promiſe, that the Gates of Hell ſhould not prevail againſt his Church, that the Holy Ghoſt ſhould abide with the Apoſtles, and their Succeſſors, and Teach them all Truth, for four and five hundred years: Or for the time of the <hi>Primitive Church;</hi> but even for ever. And therefore the ordinary <hi>Doctors</hi> and <hi>Paſtors</hi> of all Ages, are
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:95768:60"/> equally aſſiſted by the <hi>Holy Ghoſt,</hi> and equally free from erring in mattters of Faith.</p>
            <p>Fifthly, I require, That my <hi>Antagoniſt</hi> aſſail me with no other Weapons, than what the Light of Reaſon, and the expreſs Text of Gods Word, will furniſh him withal: The expreſs Text I ſay, of God's Word: for I will not allow him to Interpret- Or accept of his Interpretation, againſt the Interpretation of the <hi>Antient Fathers,</hi> of the <hi>General Councels,</hi> of the ever <hi>Viſible Church</hi> of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> unleſs he can prove, by manifeſt Miracles, that God hath ſent him into the World, to read us a new Divinity, and to Interpret his Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Word, otherwiſe than his <hi>Antient Paſtors</hi> have done. Which things if he cannot perform, let him in ſilence at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to his own Salvation: and making uſe of that Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, which he may learn out of this <hi>Treatiſe,</hi> let him time<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly return to the <hi>Roman Church,</hi> out of whoſe Communion moſt certainly, he will never be able to obtain Salvation.</p>

            <head>THE APPENDIX.</head>
            <p>
               <hi>Whether the</hi> Apoſtles <hi>were</hi> Proteſtants, <hi>or no.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>PRoteſtants</hi> generally conceive, and believe, that <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> and his <hi>Apoſtles</hi> Preached and planted in the World, the <hi>Proteſtant Religion,</hi> even the very ſelf-ſame, that <hi>Proteſtants</hi> now believe and practice; and that they were really <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> not in Name, but in their Belief and Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice: And that they inſtituted their Diſciples and Follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, that is, the firſt <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> in the ſelf-ſame Liberty of Goſpel, which <hi>Proteſtants</hi> now follow; and charged them, that with all Care and Diligence, they ſhould deliver this ſweet and eaſie <hi>Religion</hi> (which is ſo pleaſing to Fleſh and Blood) to thoſe, who were to ſucceed them; that ſo for ever it might be continued in the World, for the Salvation of Mankind.</p>
            <p>Thus, I ſay, do <hi>Proteſtants</hi> generally conceive; and upon the Truth of this Conceipt, they hazard their Souls, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding that they are not agreed, nor cannot yet agree among themſelves, (which makes the matter very ſtrange, and the conceipt wholly improbable) whether the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> in their Belief and Practice of <hi>Religion,</hi> were <hi>Lutherans,</hi> or <hi>Anabaptiſts,</hi> or <hi>Swinglians,</hi> or <hi>Calviniſts,</hi> or <hi>New Arians,</hi> or <hi>Quakers,</hi> or <hi>Arminians,</hi> or <hi>Parliamentary Preteſtants,</hi> for each of theſe ſorts or Branches of <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> lay Claim to the <hi>Apoſtles:</hi> and the Learned of each ſort, do bear their Followers in hand, That the Doctrine which they Teach, is the pure Light of
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:95768:61"/> the Goſpel, even the ſelf-ſame, that the Bleſſed <hi>Apoſtles</hi> Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved, Taught, and practiſed: and of this they are all cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain alike.</p>
            <p>And ſo the conceipt of <hi>Saxony, Denmark, Sweden,</hi> is, that the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> were <hi>Lutherans.</hi> The Conceipt of ſome of the <hi>Cantons</hi> of <hi>Switzerland</hi> is, that they were <hi>Swinglians.</hi> The Conceipt of many in <hi>Moravia,</hi> and in <hi>Holland,</hi> is, that they were <hi>Anabaptiſts.</hi> The Conceipt of <hi>Geneva,</hi> of <hi>Scotland,</hi> of <hi>Puritans</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> and of ſome parts of <hi>Germany,</hi> is, that they were <hi>Calviniſts.</hi> The Conceipt of divers in <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Holland,</hi> is, that they were <hi>Quakers:</hi> And the Conceipt of the <hi>Proteſtant Church</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> is, that the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> were of the ſame Belief, and practiſed the ſame Worſhip of God, that by Act of Parliament, is here ſettled and eſtabliſhed.</p>
            <p>But to ſpeak the Truth, as it is impoſſible, that the <hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles</hi> ſhould be of all theſe Beliefs; ſo it is more than probable, that they were of none of them; but rather, that all theſe Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liefs are meer conjectural Conceipts of <hi>new Teachers,</hi> who are wholly uncertain of what Belief the Apoſtles were. For if they were certain, that the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> were of ſome one of theſe Beliefs, they would all, doubtleſs, be of the ſame. But the Learned of the <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> being indeed altogether uncertain, and really ignorant of the Faith and Practiſe of the Apoſtles, by gueſſing thereat, ſo near as they can, they have divided themſelves into ſo many Branches, and into ſo many con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary Faiths and practiſes; each of them having nothing, but his own conjecture, to lead him to the true Light of the Goſpel, and to the <hi>right Religion</hi> of the <hi>Apoſtles.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But notwithſtanding, that <hi>Proteſtants</hi> do thus differ about <hi>Religion;</hi> and are uncertain of the Faith and practice of the <hi>Apoſtles:</hi> Yet they will not, forſooth, have it deny'd, but that the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> were <hi>Proteſtants;</hi> and that they planted in
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:95768:61"/> the World, the <hi>Proteſtant Religion.</hi> And ſo it muſt be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed, that they Taught: That we are juſtified by <hi>Faith</hi> only: That we have not <hi>Free-will</hi> in the works of Grace: That our beſt Works are impure, and ſtained with Sin: That we do not merit by them, either Increaſe of Grace, or Glory: That by Faith in <hi>Chriſt,</hi> we are freed from the Yoke of the Law, which is ſuch as no man can keep; and therefore <hi>Chriſt,</hi> having fulfilled it for us, our breach there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, doth neither wound the Conſcience, nor endanger the Soul.</p>
            <p>Moreover, according to this ſuppoſed Doctrine of the <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> we are not bound to confeſs our Sins to the <hi>Prieſts of God's Church:</hi> or to do <hi>pennance</hi> for them: no Works of ours being truly ſatisfactory: Neither is Sin pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed any where after this Life, but in Hell; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we need not fear any purging Flames, <hi>Chriſt</hi> having paid for all. Furthermore, we are not bound in Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to <hi>Faſt,</hi> or to abſtain from <hi>Fleſh,</hi> upon certain days, according as the Church doth appoint, this being contrary to the <hi>Liberty of the Goſpel.</hi> It is likewiſe, vain, fooliſh, <hi>ſuperſtitious,</hi> to endeavour to gain Heaven by Prayer, Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting, Almſ-deeds; by a Holy and mortified Life; or to Vow <hi>Poverty, Chaſtity,</hi> and Obedience; or to eſteem <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual Virginity</hi> Conſecrated to God, better, more noble, and more pleaſing to God, than <hi>Marriage.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Again, according to the ſame ſuppoſed Apoſtolical Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, the <hi>Church of Chriſt</hi> is ſubject to Erring, in her Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of Faith; and therefore we are not tyed, to believe as ſhe Teaches, further than we eſteem her Doctrine, to agree with the written Word: for to be ſo tyed, is againſt the <hi>Liberty of the Goſpel.</hi> Againſt which <hi>Liberty</hi> alſo it is, that <hi>Biſhops</hi> and <hi>Prieſts,</hi> ſhould be tyed to live Chaſte and
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:95768:62"/> Single Lives. Laſtly, all ſorts of <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> ſaving <hi>Luthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rans,</hi> eſteem the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> to have believed, and taught that the <hi>Euchariſt</hi> is not the true <hi>Body</hi> and <hi>Blood of Chriſt,</hi> but a Figure or Remembrance thereof. And ſo they conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently hold, that <hi>Christ</hi> left no true and proper <hi>Sacrifice</hi> to be daily offered in his <hi>Church;</hi> nor no <hi>true Prieſt-hood</hi> which cannot ſubſiſt without a <hi>true Sacrifice.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This is the Conceipt of <hi>Proteſtants</hi> in general, real, or pretended: Real, it may be, of the ignorant and ſimple: but pretended only, I believe, by the Underſtanding and Learned: For theſe cannot but know, that if the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> indeed, had been <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> and really had Preached, ſpread, and ſettled amongſt the Nations of the Earth (to which they Preached in <hi>Aſia, Europe,</hi> and <hi>Africa)</hi> the <hi>Proteſtant Religion,</hi> which is ſo eaſie and ſo pleaſing to Fleſh and Blood; that the ſame had continued infallibly, at leaſt for ſome while, in the following Ages; and that it could not poſſibly, morally ſpeaking; ſo, upon the ſudden, have been caſt aſide, and extinguiſhed, in all places at once, but that there would have remained illuſtrious Memory thereof, at leaſt in ſome of the <hi>primordial Churches;</hi> in ſome of the <hi>Countries, Provinces,</hi> or <hi>Cities,</hi> where the <hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles</hi> Preached. This I think, no underſtanding man will deny.</p>
            <p>1. Becauſe the firſt <hi>Chriſtians</hi> were <hi>zealous Followers,</hi> and Imitators of the Doctrine, and manners of the <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> of whom they had a high eſteem; as alſo of their Doctrine, which they knew the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> had confirmed, by many true and Divine Miracles.</p>
            <p>2. Becauſe they were very careful of their own <hi>Salvation,</hi> as is evident, by their admirable Conſtancy, in ſuffering <hi>Loſſes, Tribulations, Torments,</hi> yea <hi>terrible Deaths</hi> in the
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:95768:62"/> cruel and bloody Perſecutions raiſed againſt them by the <hi>Roman Emperours,</hi> for the ſpace almoſt of Three Hundred Years. How then is it likely, if thus they ſuffer'd to ſave their Souls, that they would wilfully caſt them away, by forſaking the <hi>true Religion</hi> of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> which his Bleſſed <hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles</hi> had planted, and ſo firmly ſettled amongſt them, to follow another of their own inventing? Eſpecially ſeeing, that living ſo near the time of our <hi>Saviour,</hi> and of his <hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles,</hi> they could not be ignorant, what <hi>Religion,</hi> He and They, had Taught and Planted. Did they more eſteem of the Religion of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> than of all their Worldly Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents, and prefer the Profeſſion thereof, before their own Lives, and yet did they wittingly, and willingly abandon, and forſake it, not for the good and ſafety, but even to the certain <hi>perdition of their Souls?</hi> Who will ſo judge, but miſ-led, and blinded Souls?</p>
            <p>3. Becauſe ſuch a change as this, in the <hi>Religion</hi> of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> which is the Heart and Marrow of his Church, is directly contrary to the predictions of the Prophets, and Promiſes of <hi>Chriſt</hi> himſelf. For <hi>Daniel</hi> foretold, <hi>cap.</hi> 2. and <hi>cap.</hi> 7. <hi>That the Kingdom,</hi> that is, the Church of Chriſt, <hi>ſhould ſtand for ever,</hi> and ſhould <hi>never be corrupted. Iſaias</hi> fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>told, <hi>cap.</hi> 59. that the <hi>Word and Spirit of God,</hi> ſhould <hi>ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver depart from the mouth,</hi> that is, from the teaching of the Church. <hi>Chriſt</hi> promiſed, <hi>Mat.</hi> 16. that <hi>the Gates of Hell ſhould never prevail againſt his Church:</hi> that the <hi>Holy Ghoſt</hi> ſhould abide with his Apoſtles <hi>for ever,</hi> that is, with them and their Succeſſors, <hi>even to the end of the World,</hi> Joh. <hi>cap.</hi> 14. and ſhould <hi>teach them all truth,</hi> John, <hi>cap.</hi> 16. All which had been falſe, if the <hi>Proteſtant Religion,</hi> planted by <hi>Chriſt</hi> and his <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> by the Folly and Wickedneſs of the Succeſſors of the ſame Apoſtles, had been rejected and abandoned, as <hi>Proteſtants</hi> imagine, and <hi>Papiſtry</hi> brought in, inſtead thereof.</p>
            <pb n="100" facs="tcp:95768:63"/>
            <p> 5. The impoſſibility of ſuch a change, is clearly ſhewed, and plainly convinced, out of the natural Inclination, and common cuſtom, of all Societies of men; which is, as evident experience doth teach, rather to deſcend, then aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cend; rather to fall, than to riſe; rather to ſlide to looſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and to more liberty, than to aſpire to more ſtrictneſs, and to greater Sanctity; unleſs the ſpecial Grace of God do ſtay them, and incite, and ſtir them up, which muſt not be here admitted of; becauſe God by his Grace, doth not uſe to draw men from the pure <hi>Light of the Goſpel,</hi> to embrace <hi>falſe and erroneous Doctrine,</hi> and to follow <hi>ſuperſtitious and Idolatrous practiſes;</hi> as <hi>Proteſtants</hi> imagine <hi>Chriſtians</hi> to have been drawn in the <hi>primitive Church.</hi> And therefore it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be deny'd, with any colour of Truth, but that <hi>good Diſcipline, Conſcientious Dealing, virtuous courſes, ſtrictneſs of Life,</hi> and the <hi>practice of Godly Actions,</hi> do rather de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cay by tract of time, than get ground, and increaſe in all <hi>Communities</hi> and <hi>Societies</hi> of Men: And on the contrary, <hi>Liberty, Eaſe, Idleneſs, Senſuality,</hi> do ever rather increaſe, than decay, and vaniſh away of themſelves, as evident ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience doth teach: For as the Poet ſaith, <hi>tendimus in vetitum ſemper cupimuſque negata: We tend toward things for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden ſtill, and covet things denyed.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This is manifeſt; Firſt, by the decay of good Order, of honeſt and upright dealing in <hi>Commonwealths;</hi> which hath cauſed ſo many new Laws, ſo many new <hi>Orders</hi> and <hi>Statutes,</hi> to have been made, Decreed and Enacted by Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pream Authority, to repreſs the bad and vicious Inclinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of men.</p>
            <p>2. By the decay of <hi>Eccleſiaſtical Diſcipline,</hi> from time to time, in the <hi>Church of Chriſt,</hi> which hath occaſioned the
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:95768:63"/> Pious Endeavours of ſo many Zealous and <hi>Apoſtolical Preachers,</hi> of ſo many <hi>Holy Biſhips,</hi> of ſo many <hi>Godly Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perours, Kings</hi> and <hi>Princes,</hi> to reform and reſtore the ſame, by the help of <hi>General,</hi> of <hi>National,</hi> of <hi>Provincial Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>3. By that, which hath happened to moſt of the <hi>Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Orders</hi> of the <hi>Catholick Church:</hi> For although theſe <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Congregations,</hi> have ever begun with great Zeal and Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour, and have been furniſhed with ſpecial Helps to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue the ſame; yet through Humane Frailty, by tract of time, they have ſo fallen off, that <hi>Reformation</hi> hath often been needful.</p>
            <p>4. In <hi>Cities,</hi> in <hi>Colledges,</hi> in <hi>particular Families, Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> is often, and <hi>vigilancy of Superiours,</hi> is ever needful. Yea, who is it, though never ſo Saintly, though never ſo well inclin'd and accuſtomed to Virtue, that finds not, that his Inclinations have ever need of repreſſing, and his Manners often of Refining?</p>
            <p>5. The ſame appeareth evidently in all the Nations of the Earth, which hitherto have been Converted to Chriſt, which ever, by degrees, fall from their firſt <hi>Fervour, Zeal,</hi> and <hi>Devotion,</hi> of which we have a clear example in the Word of God, <hi>Rev.</hi> 2. 4. <hi>I have againſt thee,</hi> ſaith <hi>Chriſt</hi> to the <hi>Biſhop</hi> and <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Epheſus, a few things, becauſe thou haſt left thy firſt charity: Be mindful therefore from whence thou art fallen, and do pennance, and do thy firſt Works,</hi> &amp;c. If Pennance was needful ſo quickly; if even in the times of the Apoſtles, Charity, <hi>Zeal, Fervour,</hi> Sanctity, decayed among <hi>Chriſtian people,</hi> how much more afterwards, in the Ages following?</p>
            <pb n="102" facs="tcp:95768:64"/>
            <p> How then is it ſo much as probable, yea rather, how is it not altogether improbable, and even incredible, that the Chriſtians of the <hi>Primitive Church,</hi> through all the World, of themſelves, of their own accord, without any Warrant from <hi>Chriſt</hi> and his <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> but rather contrary to His, and their Doctrine and Practice, without any good to themſelves, yea even contrary to the Eternal Good, and ſafety of their Souls; did caſt aſide, fall from, abandon the <hi>eaſie, belly-pleaſing,</hi> and <hi>ſweet liberty</hi> of the <hi>Proteſtant Goſpel,</hi> to embrace and practice the <hi>hard, harſh, auſtere,</hi> and <hi>mortifying Diſcipline</hi> of <hi>Papiſtry.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In ſuch ſort, that neglecting the <hi>Doctrine</hi> of <hi>Chriſt</hi> and his <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> and the example of their Lives, yet freſh in memory amongſt them, they fell to believe, contrary there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto, as <hi>Proteſtants</hi> imagine, that we are juſtifyed, not by <hi>Faith</hi> only, but by <hi>Faith, Hope, Charity,</hi> and other <hi>Divine Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues;</hi> that we have <hi>Free-will</hi> in the Works of <hi>Grace;</hi> that Works of <hi>Grace,</hi> done in the ſtate of <hi>Grace,</hi> do truly merit the increaſe of <hi>Grace</hi> and of <hi>Glory;</hi> That we are bound under pain of <hi>Damnation,</hi> to keep the <hi>Commandments</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> by abſtai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning from all great and mortal Sins, ſuch, as are the Profeſſion of falſe <hi>Religions,</hi> the denyal of the <hi>Truth, Perjury, Murder, Fornication, Theft,</hi> in a notable quantity, <hi>Couſenage, <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſury,</hi> and the like; that we are able to keep them, by the help of Divine Grace; of which God, for the merits of our <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour,</hi> doth meaſure to every Man a ſufficient quantity.</p>
            <p>That we are bound, under pain of <hi>Damnation,</hi> to Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs all our mortal Sins, ſo far forth as with reaſonable Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence, we can call to mind, to ſome lawful <hi>Prieſt</hi> or other; That we are bound under the ſame Penalty, to reſtore all <hi>Goods</hi> and <hi>Lands</hi> unlawfully gotten; to <hi>Faſt,</hi> and to <hi>ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtain from Fleſh,</hi> as the <hi>Church</hi> appointeth and commandeth;
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:95768:64"/> That ordinarily, when our Sins are forgiven, God doth reſerve ſome Temporal Pain, or Puniſhment, for which (if we get it not releaſed in this Life, by <hi>Prayer, Faſting, Almſ-deeds,</hi> and other <hi>holy, laborious,</hi> and <hi>penitential works)</hi> we ſhall ſuffer terribly, in the <hi>purging Fire</hi> of the next. That to Vow <hi>perpetual Poverty, Chaſtity,</hi> and <hi>Obedience,</hi> is very <hi>meritorious</hi> and pleaſing to God; That <hi>Virginity</hi> vow'd and Conſecrated to God, is better than <hi>Matrimony;</hi> That <hi>Biſhops</hi> and <hi>Prieſts</hi> ought to live <hi>chaſte</hi> and <hi>ſingle Lives.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That the <hi>Body</hi> and <hi>Blood</hi> of <hi>Chriſt</hi> is truly and really in the <hi>Bleſſed Sacrament,</hi> which <hi>Sacrament</hi> is alſo truly and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly a <hi>Sacrifice, Chriſt</hi> therein being truly offered, to his Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Father, in an unbloody manner, under the forms of <hi>Bread</hi> and <hi>Wine;</hi> which Sacrifice doth not only repreſent the <hi>Sacrifice</hi> of the <hi>Croſs,</hi> but it doth alſo copiouſly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply the ſame to thoſe, for whom it is Offered, both as it is <hi>impetratory,</hi> and alſo as it is <hi>ſatisfactory:</hi> That it is not law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, to interpret the Scriptures, contrary to the Interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Church; or to reject any parts thereof by Her approved: But in this, and in all other things, appertaining to <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Religion,</hi> we are bound under pain of Dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, to ſubmit our Judgements to the Teaching of the <hi>Church,</hi> and to believe as She doth direct us.</p>
            <p>Theſe, and the like Points, profeſſed now in the <hi>Roman Church,</hi> were in practice amongſt the <hi>Primitive Chriſtians,</hi> which lived preſently after the <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> as is manifeſt, not only by the <hi>Records</hi> of Antiquity, but alſo by their Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice, which clearly ſheweth their <hi>Faith,</hi> For <hi>Faſting,</hi> the <hi>keeping of Lent,</hi> the abſtaining from <hi>Fleſh</hi> on <hi>Fridays,</hi> the Vowing of <hi>Virginity,</hi> of <hi>perpetual Chaſtity, Monaſtical Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline,</hi> the wearing of <hi>Hair-cloth,</hi> and other like <hi>Auſterities,</hi> the ſingle Life of the <hi>Clergy,</hi> and the like, were in uſe, and
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:95768:65"/> did wonderfully flouriſh amongſt them. Inſomuch, that <hi>Sebaſtianus Francus,</hi> a Learned <hi>Anabaptiſt,</hi> ſearching moſt curiouſly among the Writers of former Ages, after the <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant Religion,</hi> and finding no Footſteps thereof in all An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquity, even up to the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> times, he freely and bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly affirmeth, in his Epiſtle, of abrogating all Eccleſiaſtical Statutes, <hi>That preſently after the</hi> Apoſtles <hi>times, all things were turned upſide down,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>and that for certain, through the work of</hi> Antichriſt, <hi>the External Church, together with the Faith and Sacraments, vaniſhed away, preſently after the</hi> Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles <hi>departure.</hi> Into which Blaſphemy, this Learned <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant</hi> would never have fallen, if he could have found any certain ſigns of the <hi>Proteſtant Religion</hi> among the <hi>Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive Chriſtians,</hi> which lived preſently after the Apoſtles: or could have inclined his Conſcience to outface the matter, with ſtout lying, as many of his Fellows do, to conceal the <hi>Truth</hi> in this point, from the Eyes of well-mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning People.</p>
            <p>The ſame in effect, is affirmed by <hi>Coelius Secundus Curio,</hi> a <hi>Learned Proteſtant</hi> alſo, in his Book of the Amplitude of the Kingdom of God, <hi>Lib.</hi> I. <hi>pag.</hi> 43. <hi>Are we ignorant,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>in how great Darkneſs and Blindneſs the World hath con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued, almoſt from the</hi> Apoſtles <hi>Age, to theſe our times, in which, beyond all expectation, the Lord hath begun to manifeſt himſelf?</hi> The <hi>Proteſtant</hi> Author of the Book Entituled, <hi>Antichriſtus,</hi> or <hi>Prognoſtica finis mundi, pag.</hi> 13. affirms like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, <hi>That from the</hi> Apoſtles <hi>times, till</hi> Luther, <hi>the Goſpel had never open paſſage.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To that there can no doubt be made, but that the firſt Chriſtians, who lived preſently after the <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> did for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake and abandon the eaſie, pleaſing, and ſweet Liberty of the <hi>Proteſtant Religion</hi> (if ever they were taught it by
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:95768:65"/> the Apoſtles) and fell of themſelves, through all the world, to believe and practice the hard and harſh Diſcipline of <hi>Papiſtry,</hi> contrary to the cuſtom of Mankind. The which how improbable; yea, how impoſſible it is? Who is ſo ſenſeleſs, that he doth not ſee? Which improbability, and moral impoſſibility, will appear yet much more clearly; if we take into our conſideration, that not only a few ignorant People, muſt be thought, thus to have neglected and aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned the <hi>Doctrine</hi> and <hi>Diſcipline</hi> of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and of his <hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles,</hi> (if that indeed was ſuch, as is now believed and pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſed by <hi>Proteſtants)</hi> and to have preferred, without any neceſſity, without any Utility, yea, with manifeſt peril of their Souls, <hi>Faſting</hi> before <hi>Feaſting; Pennance</hi> before <hi>Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure; Labour</hi> before <hi>Eaſe; courſe Dyet</hi> before <hi>Dainties; hard Couches</hi> before Beds of <hi>Down; rough Hair-cloth</hi> before <hi>ſoft cloathing;</hi> a <hi>mortified, chaſte,</hi> and <hi>ſingle Life,</hi> before the <hi>delights of Wedlock;</hi> ſeeking fooliſhly, as <hi>Proteſtants</hi> imagine, to curb and bring under the Appetites of the Fleſh, and to rid themſelves of the <hi>moleſting temptations</hi> thereof, rather by <hi>ſevere, harſh,</hi> and <hi>cruel uſage of their Bodies,</hi> than by the pleaſing remedy of a <hi>Female Conſort,</hi> as <hi>Proteſtant Miniſters</hi> uſe to do.</p>
            <p>Not only, I ſay, the ignorant and vulgar ſort, muſt be thought, thus to have neglected the ſweet liberty of the <hi>Proteſtant Goſpel</hi> (if ever the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> had ſettled them in it) and to have embraced fooliſhly and madly the <hi>hard</hi> and <hi>ſevere Diſcipline of Papiſtry:</hi> but the better ſort alſo, even the Learned and <hi>Holy Fathers</hi> of the <hi>primitive Church,</hi> ſuch as were <hi>Dioniſius, Ignatius, Cyprian, Athanaſius, Baſil</hi> the Great, <hi>Gregory</hi> the Divine, <hi>Chryſoſtome, Hierom, Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broſe, Auguſtine,</hi> and others, the chief and principal Lights (after the <hi>Apoſtles)</hi> of the <hi>Church of Chriſt.</hi> All which were either real Practiſers, or Praiſers of <hi>Monaſtical</hi>
               <pb n="106" facs="tcp:95768:66"/> 
               <hi>Diſcipline,</hi> of the <hi>chaſte</hi> and <hi>ſingle life,</hi> of <hi>vowed Virgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,</hi> and the like; which they would never have done moſt certainly, if theſe things had been contrary to the <hi>Doctrine</hi> and <hi>practice of Chriſt,</hi> and of the <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> and againſt the <hi>true liberty</hi> of his <hi>Divine Goſpel,</hi> of which they could not be ignorant, being ſo excellently skilled in the Scriptures as they were; and living ſo near the times of thoſe Bleſſed Founders of the <hi>Chriſtian Religion;</hi> as they did.</p>
            <p>And ſo the <hi>Doctrine</hi> and <hi>Diſcipline</hi> of the Ancient Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, and of the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> of the <hi>primitive</hi> Church, (which really was the ſame in ſubſtance, that is now in uſe in the <hi>Roman Church)</hi> do evidently convince, that the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> were not <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> neither in <hi>Doctrine,</hi> nor in <hi>Practice;</hi> but rather, that truly and really they were <hi>Papiſts,</hi> in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard that they were ſtrict Practiſers and Teachers of thoſe many points in <hi>Papiſtry,</hi> which ſo clearly ſhined in their <hi>Diſciples</hi> and <hi>Succeſſors,</hi> the <hi>Paſtors</hi> and <hi>People</hi> of the <hi>primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Church:</hi> which is ſo certain out of the <hi>Doctrine</hi> of the Antient Fathers, and other <hi>Records</hi> of <hi>Antiquity,</hi> that it cannot be denyed, with any colour of Truth. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Conceipt of thoſe <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> who imagine, that the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> practiſed and taught the <hi>eaſie Diſcipline</hi> and <hi>Belly-pleaſing liberty</hi> of their new Goſpel, is but a meer <hi>fancy,</hi> a <hi>vain</hi> and <hi>empty Dream,</hi> there being no colourable ground thereof at all: neither in the Word of God; nor in the Records of Antiquity.</p>
            <p>Out of which <hi>Records,</hi> how little may be expected, to prove that the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> were <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> doth ſufficiently appear, by that which hath been ſaid: For if by them it doth appear, as moſt certainly it doth, that <hi>much Faſting, great auſterity of life, Monaſtical Diſcipline,</hi> the <hi>vowing of</hi>

               <hi>Virginity,</hi> of <hi>perpetual chaſtity,</hi> and <hi>ſingle life in the Clergy,</hi> did greatly flouriſh among the <hi>firſt Chriſtians;</hi> what Hop can there be, to gather from thence, that the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> were <hi>Proteſtants?</hi> certainly, none at all.</p>
            <p>And as for the <hi>Scriptures,</hi> as from thence, we may eaſily gather, that the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> were <hi>Papiſts:</hi> So we find not there the leaſt Sign, that they were <hi>Proteſtants.</hi> For if, as Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon dictates, we will judge of their <hi>Faith</hi> by their practice; we cannot admit, that in Faith they were like the <hi>Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants,</hi> ſeeing, that in their practice they were plainly <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts.</hi> For they lived perpetually Chaſte; yea, and if ever any other, they alſo Guelded themſelves for the <hi>Kingdom of Heaven,</hi> by a Vow of <hi>perpetual chaſtity,</hi> according to the Counſel of our Saviour, given <hi>Matth.</hi> 19. 12. They <hi>forſook all</hi> to follow Chriſt, and to attain to perfection, according alſo to the Counſel of Chriſt given, <hi>Matth.</hi> 19. 21. as Saint <hi>Peter</hi> doth confidently profeſs, <hi>Matth.</hi> 19. 27. whereby they practiſed both <hi>Poverty</hi> and <hi>Obedience:</hi> Poverty, in forſaking all: Obedience, in following Chriſt: wherein they were ſo exact, that they doubted not at his appointment, to leave both <hi>Country</hi> and <hi>Friends,</hi> and to expoſe both them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves and their <hi>Lives</hi> to infinite <hi>Labours</hi> and <hi>Hazards;</hi> while they enterprized the Converſion of the <hi>Gentiles</hi> from their carnal and inveterate Idolatry, to the Holy and Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine <hi>Religion</hi> of Chriſt. And therefore we may truly ſay, that the Apoſtles were <hi>Religious</hi> Men, even ſuch as are in the <hi>Catholick Church,</hi> practiſing <hi>Poverty, Chaſtity,</hi> and <hi>Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience,</hi> and imitating thereby, in an excellent manner, their Bleſſed Maſter, who was ſo poor, that he had not where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to repoſe his Head, <hi>Luke</hi> 9. 58. So Chaſte, and ſo great a Friend of Chaſtity, that even he would be born of a Virgin: and ſo Obedient (as he was Man) to his Heavenly Father, that he gave his Life at his appointment, for the
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:95768:67"/> 
               <hi>Redemption</hi> and Salvation of Mankind, <hi>Philip.</hi> 2. 8. By the practices of which excellent Virtues, this Bleſſed Lord laid the Foundation, of the <hi>Regular,</hi> or <hi>Religious</hi> Life (con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting chiefly in the profeſſion and due obſervance, of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual <hi>Poverty, Chaſtity,</hi> and <hi>Obedience)</hi> ſo much practiced afterwards in his Church: For from him, as from the Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Fountain, the ſame hath hitherto flowed, and doth yet flow with ſo full a Stream, in his true and <hi>Catholick Church:</hi> For the Vowing of theſe things had never been of ſo high eſteem, and of ſo frequent uſe among the Ancient and <hi>Learned Fathers,</hi> and the choiceſt pieces of <hi>Chriſtian Sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,</hi> had it not been the neareſt imitation of the <hi>Holy</hi> and <hi>mortified Life</hi> of <hi>Chriſt:</hi> and of the practice of the <hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles,</hi> of <hi>John</hi> the <hi>Baptiſt,</hi> of <hi>Elias.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To which practice of the <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> if we add their fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent Praying, <hi>Act.</hi> 2. 42. <hi>Act.</hi> 12. 5. <hi>Act.</hi> 10. 9. and their often Watching, and much Faſting, <hi>Act.</hi> 14. 22. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6. 5. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. 27. it will manifeſtly appear, that they were as far from being <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> as <hi>Monks</hi> and <hi>Fryers</hi> now are: Theſe things being wholly out of uſe amongſt Proteſtants, and not only contrary to the Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of their new Goſpel, but even fruitleſs, vain, ſuperſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous toys, according to the Tenets and Principles thereof. By all which it ſeems to be manifeſtly Convinced, that the <hi>Apoſtles of our Saviour</hi> were not <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> but rather tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and really <hi>Papiſts,</hi> both in their <hi>Belief</hi> and <hi>practice;</hi> their outward practice ſhewing their inward Belief, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to that of our Saviour: <hi>Out of the abundance of the Heart the mouth ſpeaketh, Mat.</hi> 12. 34.</p>
            <p>But if any <hi>Proteſtants</hi> will be yet ſo wilful, that he will maintain, againſt manifeſt Reaſon, that the <hi>Proteſtant Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion</hi> was in the times of the <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> though afterwards
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:95768:67"/> it appeared not in the World, till <hi>Luther</hi> reviv'd it: I muſt tell him, that this doth not only prove, that the <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant Religion</hi> is not the <hi>true Religion</hi> of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> which muſt ever be extant in the World, for the <hi>Salvation of Souls:</hi> but further alſo it ſhews, that it is a very vile and <hi>naughty Religion;</hi> ſeeing the whole <hi>Chriſtian World</hi> did ſo ſoon forſake and caſt it aſide: notwithſtanding, that it is ſo eaſie and ſo pleaſing to the Carnal Appetites of men. And ſo <hi>Proteſtants</hi> cannot reap much true comfort, by imagining, that their <hi>Religion</hi> was in the times of the <hi>Apoſtles;</hi> ſeeing all the <hi>Antient Saints</hi> and <hi>Learned Fathers,</hi> yea, even the whole <hi>Chriſtian World</hi> thought it not worth the regarding.</p>
